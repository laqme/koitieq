## Content clauses

A content clause is introduced by _ꝡá_{:.t} "that". It turns the following clause into a noun phrase ("the fact that…") so that it can act as the subject or object of another clause.

> _Jıa dana súq nháo. Chı jí hú._{:.t}<br>
> You will defeat him. I believe it.
>
> _Chı jí, **ꝡá** jıa dana súq nháo._{:.t}<br>
> I believe **that** you will defeat him.

A verb can relate two content clauses. For example, the following sentence uses _laheq_{:.t} "▯ entails/implies ▯".

> _Laheq, **ꝡá** zudeq súq Tóaqzu, **ꝡá** Toaqpoq súq._{:.t}<br>
> The fact that you speak Toaq implies that you're a Toaqist.

In Toaq, we write commas around the start and end of a subclause.
