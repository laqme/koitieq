<summary>Typing Toaq</summary>
Toaq typists are sometimes in a hurry, and not all devices make it easy to write Toaq properly. It's common to see the letter _ı_{:.t} written with a dot: _jia_{:.t} instead of _jıa_{:.t}, as in Ánhe's texts above.

The letter _ꝡ_{:.t} can be even trickier to type. You'll often see _v_{:.t}, _w_{:.t}, _y_{:.t}, or _vy_{:.t} used in its place.

Tones might be omitted in a hurry, or spelled with digits --- _níchaq bï_{:.t} can become _nichaq2 bi3_{:.t} or just _nichaq bi_{:.t}. There's an article explaining various [input methods](https://toaq.me/Input_methods) on the Toaq Wiki.

## Mass nouns

Toaq doesn't treat mass nouns specially. A verb like _nao_{:.t} "▯ is water" really means "▯ is a quantity of water". So _tú nao_{:.t} means "each mass of water" — for example, it might quantify over all the _waters_ in everyone's glasses at a dinner table.

## Adjectives

In Toaq, verbs can be used as adjectives by placing them after a "noun". When you see an article followed by two verbs, it's a so-called adjective modifying a so-called noun.

> _sá karı **noqchoı**_{:.t}<br>
> some **spicy** curry
>
> _tú choko **nuı**_{:.t}<br>
> each **small** chocolate

Of course, because everything is verbs, you have a bit more freedom than in other languages.

> _ké **kıa**_{:.t}<br>
> the **red one(s)**
>
> _ké noqchoı **kıa**_{:.t}<br>
> the **red** spicy thing
>
> _ké kıa **noqchoı**_{:.t}<br>
> the **spicy** red thing

<summary>Are adjectives "intersective"?</summary>
It makes sense to point at an elephant and say "this is a small elephant", but it's a bit strange to call it a "small animal", right?

The meaning of _sá elu nuı_{:.t} (a small elephant) might not be as simple as "_x_ is an elephant and _x_ is small." Rather, there's a notion of being "small for an elephant" that this phrase captures. We say that adjectives do the same thing in Toaq.

As such, there is a slight difference between _sá nuı de_{:.t} (a small thing that's pretty compared to the average small thing) and _sá de nuı_{:.t} (a pretty thing that's small compared to the average pretty thing.)

Linguists call adjectives like _small_ **non-intersective**. Other adjectives, like _red_, are **intersective**, meaning that a "red house" really is simply a house which is red.

## Tenses _pu, naı, jıa, mala_{:.t}

By default, Toaq sentences don't express tense. You can place these words before the verb of a sentence to mark when it takes place:

| Word | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| _pu_{:.t} | past tense |
| _naı_{:.t} | present tense |
| _jıa_{:.t} | future tense |
| _mala_{:.t} | existential past |

The word _pu_{:.t} expresses that something happened in a contextually limited past:

> _**Pu** tı jí Súomıgua._{:.t}<br>
> I was in Finland. (e.g. at the time)

Whereas _mala_{:.t} is unlimited, and expresses that the claim in the sentence held at _some_ time in the unbounded past.

> _**Mala** tı jí Súomıgua._{:.t}<br>
> I've been in Finland. (at some point in life)

<details class="aside semantics" markdown="1">
<summary>The default tense</summary>

The default tense is a "vague, definite time reference." Wait, how can it be both vague _and_ definite?! Let's look at an example.

> _Chuq jí ké sushı._{:.t}<br>
> (During time _t_,) I eat the sushi.

It's definite, in the sense that we constrain the existence of the eating-event to some time _t_ that we have in mind, but it's also vague, in that we don't say when this time _t_ is.

The default tense has a spoken form, too: _tuom_{:.t}. But it's rarely used — mostly just when doing Toaqology.

The difference between _pu_{:.t} and _mala_{:.t} is that _pu_{:.t} only adds the detail that this vague, definite time _t_ is in the past, whereas _mala_{:.t} introduces an existential quantifier.

> _**Pu** chuq jí ké sushı._{:.t}<br>
> (During time _t_, **which is in the past**,) I eat the sushi.

> _**Mala** chuq jí ké sushı._{:.t}<br>
> **There exists a past time _t_, at which** I eat the sushi.
