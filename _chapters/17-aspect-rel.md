## Aspects

In grammar, **aspect** tells us how the time an event **happened** relates to the time we're actually **referencing**.

For example, "I will be sleeping" and "I will have slept" both refer to the future. But in the first sentence, the sleeping event _surrounds_ that future time, and in the second sentence, the sleeping is _before_ that future time.

The default aspect is _tam_{:.t}, which views the event as a whole and places it within the reference time. Even though it's already implied by default, you can say _tam_{:.t} explicitly to really emphasize this "point-event" perspective.

> _Pu **tam** faq sá luaı._{:.t} \
> Something funny happened.

The very common aspect word _chum_{:.t} expresses the progressive aspect, like the English "-ing" form. This means the reference time is contained within the event time.

> _Pu **chum** koı íme._{:.t} \
> We were walking.

<details class="aside semantics" markdown="1">
<summary>Aspect semantics</summary>

The "reference time" is the time interval _t_ contributed by the tense particle, and an event has a **temporal trace** _τ(e)_ telling us the interval it plays out over.

Then, for example, in _jıa luı nuo jí_{:.t}:

- _nuo jí_{:.t} part says there was some sleeping-event _e_
- _jıa_{:.t} says that the reference time _t_ is in the future,
- _luı_{:.t} bridges the gap between the two, saying _τ_(_e_) &lt; _t_.

<summary>Inertia worlds</summary>

Consider the sentence: _"I was logging in, when suddenly the computer crashed."_ We can't really analyze this as referring to a complete logging-in event, as no such event exists. We are refering to what _would_ have been a complete logging-in event in an alternative world where the computer didn't crash.

Such alternative worlds — where the things that stop us from what we're doing don't happen, and the future is maximally compatible with the past — are called **inertia worlds**. They were introduced by David Dowty in his 1979 book _Word Meaning and Montague Grammar_ to explain sentences like the above.

In Toaq, _pu chum haqbaı jí_{:.t} is analyzed like so:

> For all inertia worlds _w_ branching off from the past time _t_, there is some cooking-event in _w_ such that _t_ ⊆ _τ_(_e_).

This way, we can use the progressive aspect even for events that never quite fully take form in the world as we're discussing it.

## More aspects

The aspect _luı_{:.t} expresses that the event "has" happened, and now the reference time is in its aftermath. That is, the event caused some state change that is still true at the time referred to.

> _Pu **luı** gom jí._{:.t} \
> I **had** made a mistake (and now I was suffering the consequences).

The aspect _hıq_{:.t} is like _luı_{:.t}, but the event has just finished.

> _Pu **hıq** chuq jí sá karı._{:.t} \
> I **had just** eaten some curry.

The aspect _za_{:.t} means the event is yet to happen at the time referred to.

> _Pu **za** geq nháo jí._{:.t} \
> She **had yet to** meet me.

The aspect _fı_{:.t} means that, at the time referred to, the event is just about to happen.

> _Pu **fı** rıufa nháo ké doaq._{:.t} \
> She **was about to** return to the city.

## Relative clauses with _ꝡë_{:.t}

The particle _ꝡë_{:.t} goes after a noun, and starts a relative clause that _restricts_ it. Inside the clause, you can refer to that noun using _hóa_{:.t}.

> _Sıgı tú **kue, ꝡë** luı fıeq nháo **hóa**._{:.t} \
> Every **book that** he has written is interesting.

There isn't an English word for this _hóa_{:.t}, because in English, relative clauses just have a "gap" in them where the _hóa_{:.t} would go.

> _Ma zao súq ké poq, ꝡë marao jí gâq **hóa** tî ké patı?_{:.t} \
> Do you know the person that I danced with <span style="background: #8882;">&emsp;</span> at the party?

You can also use other pronouns bound by the noun the clause is attached to.

<blockquote>
<em class="t" style="vertical-align:middle">Cho jí ké fuaq, <strong>ꝡë</strong> pam <div style="font-size:28px;transform:scaleY(1.6);display:inline-block;vertical-align:middle">{</div><div style="display:inline-flex;font-size:14px;align-items:center;vertical-align:middle;flex-direction:column;line-height:1.25;"><div>hóa</div><div>máq</div><div>fúaq</div></div><div style="font-size:28px;transform:scaleY(1.6);display:inline-block;vertical-align:middle">}</div> ké shatı.</em><br>
I like the picture <strong>that's</strong> on the shirt.
</blockquote>

In the rising tone, _ꝡé_{:.t} is short for _ké ꝡë_{:.t} (the thing which…)

> _Cho jí, **ꝡé** pam **hóa** ké shatı._{:.t} \
> I like **what's** on the shirt.

## Restriction and non-restriction

By "restrict", I mean that _ꝡë_{:.t} whittles down the domain that the article selects from. This sentence makes a generic claim ranging only over _chocolate from Mexico_, not just any chocolate:

> _He cho jí báq choko, **ꝡë** sıao Méhıkogua hóa._{:.t} \
> I like chocolate **which** comes from Mexico.

There is another relative clause particle, _jü_{:.t}, which starts a **non-restrictive** relative clause. The following sentence says that I like chocolate, and incidentally, chocolate comes from Mexico.

> _He cho jí báq choko, **jü** sıao Méhıkogua hóa._{:.t} \
> I like chocolate, **which** comes from Mexico.

This subtle difference is marked by the mere presence or absence of a comma in English! In Toaq, you always write a comma, but use a different particle to start the clause.

<details class="aside grammar" markdown="1">
<summary>Relative clauses on pronouns</summary>

The word **jü** is usually what you want when attaching a relative clause to a name or pronoun. It just doesn't make sense to "restrict" such an argument, because it already refers to exactly one person.

> _Fı nuo Láqme, **jü** seakuaı hóa._{:.t}<br>
> Laqme, **who** is tired, is about to sleep.

<summary>Donkey sentences</summary>

A **donkey sentence** is a sentence that contains a variable outside of its scope island. It's named after the following example:

<blockquote>

(?!) <em class="t">Tú poq, <div class="scope t"><span class="sb"><i>ꝡë</i></span> bo póq sá aqshe,</div> nä haqdo póq <strong>áqshe</strong>.<svg style="width:200px;margin-left:-200px;margin-top:-8px;position:absolute;height:24px;"><path d="M170.5,13.5 l0,-12 l-150,0 l0,8 m-4,-4 l4,4 l4,-4" stroke="currentColor" strokeWidth="1" fill="none" /></svg></em>

<br>

Every person who owns a donkey feeds <strong>it</strong>.

</blockquote>

These sentences are hard to account for when translating Toaq into logic formulas, because such occurences are disallowed in formal logic.

> ∀[X: _poq_{:.t}(X) ∧ <span style="color:#e02">(</span> ∃[Y: _aqshe_{:.t}(Y)] _bo_{:.t}(X, Y) <span style="color:#e02">)</span>] _kıaı_{:.t}(X, <span style="text-decoration:underline wavy #e02;color:#e02">Y</span>)

These sentences are a real thorn in semantics's side. They are clearly grammatical in English, but it's very difficult to explain _why_.

For a while, Toaqists wondered if speaking a loglang means learning not to produce donkey sentences. Should we just say: "every person feeds each donkey they own"? But it turns out that these "donkey pronouns" are really everywhere in everyday speech. Can't we just make them work somehow?

These sentences more or less spawned the entire framework of _discourse representation theory_, which does away with the tree-recursive transform of clauses into first-order logic sentences, and explains this _it_ as referring to a binding in a mental "discourse structure" that updates as the listener reads or listens their way through a sentence.

Giving up so much of the classical theory is a shame. There are some theories of natural language syntax that try to explain the donkey anaphora phenomenon "as-is", and there are in turn some theories of Toaq syntax that try to adopt those explanations. One of these is based on **continuations**: see _Donkey anaphora is in-scope binding_ by Barker and Shan (2008).
