In this lesson, we'll learn how to ask questions using _hí_{:.t}, and the difference between "episodic" and "generic" sentences.

## Conversation

Lucas and Míqte find the pizzeria, but...

> **Lucas:** _Tı ké pıcarıaq hí raı?_{:.t}<br>
> **Míqte:** _Ní tıeq! Kéo, oaı, naı dom ké rıaq._{:.t.sec}<br>
> **Lucas:** _Ubaı…_{:.t}<br>
> **Míqte:** _Nho. He baı nhána báq pıca noqgı._{:.t.sec}<br>
> **Lucas:** _Kéo naı baı nhána sía raı._{:.t}<br>
> **Míqte:** _Ubaı._{:.t.sec}<br>
> **Lucas:** _Tao úmo hí raı móq?_{:.t}<br>
> **Míqte:** _Eju… enı! He cho jí máo ní sushırıaq._{:.t.sec}<br>
> **Lucas:** _Fa úmo nánı rıaq ba!_{:.t}<br>

## Asking "what" with _hí_{:.t}

The word _hí_{:.t} is a question word (like _ma_{:.t}) with the same grammar as an article: it means "which." It's also how you say "who" (which person?) and "what" (which thing?) and "where" (at which place?), and so on.

> _Jıa baı **hí** poq ké pıca?_{:.t}<br>
> Which person will make the pizza?
>
> _Sıgı **hí** kıq móq?_{:.t}<br>
> Which movie(s) is/are interesting?

<summary>Inquisitive semantics</summary>

Compared to _sá_{:.t} and _tú_{:.t}, it's hard to describe how _hí_{:.t} "works", because Toaq buys into a somewhat advanced theory of question semantics known as [inquisitive semantics](https://projects.illc.uva.nl/inquisitivesemantics/).

...I had written a rough overview here, but it's too advanced even for one of these little colorful boxes. If you really want to read it, though, it's [on the Toaq wiki](https://toaq.me/Inquisitive_semantics).

## Episodic and generic sentences

_He_{:.t} is a tense-like word, used to make statements that are true "as a rule" or "in general", about no specific time in particular.

> _Jaı jí._{:.t}<br>
> I am/was happy (at some definite time).
>
> _**He** jaı jí._{:.t}<br>
> I am happy (as a rule).

The first sentence claims the existence of a "me-happy event". In fact, this is what any sentence _without_ _he_{:.t} does, and we call such sentences **episodic**. (They tell us about some single "episode" that happens.)

The second sentence, with _he_{:.t}, instead makes a **generic** claim: one that is "normally" true about the world (though not necessarily always.)

<summary>Individual-level verbs</summary>

There are some verbs that hold for the entirety of their subject's existence, and thereby escape this episodic vs. generic distinction. For example, it's hard to read _Poq jí_{:.t} as "there is some me-being-a-person event", because _poq_{:.t} never stops being true of its subject. But it's also strange to say _He poq jí_{:.t} — it's not like we are "normally/generally person-ing".

These verbs are called _individual-level_ verbs. We can imagine that _poq_{:.t} maps to some predicate that doesn't involve events whatsoever: there are no _poq_{:.t}-events, only people. Verbs for which events do make sense are called _stage-level_.

## Generic reference

Closely related is the article _báq **verb**{:.v}_{:.t}, which makes a "generic reference" to things which _verb_{:.v}, without picking any or all of them out. A simple way to think of this is that it's just like the indefinite plural in English.

> _**báq** gochıq_{:.t}<br>
> cats
>
> _**báq** choko_{:.t}<br>
> chocolate

In _episodic_ sentences, this works out to meaning the same thing as _sá_{:.t}:

> _Pu chuq jí **báq** choko._{:.t}<br>
> (There is some past event where) I ate chocolate.
>
> _Pu chuq jí **sá** choko._{:.t}<br>
> (There is some past event where) there was some chocolate that I ate.

But in combination with _he_{:.t}, we can make generic claims about generic nouns:

> _**He** kuo sá koruo._{:.t}<br>
> (As a rule,) some ravens are black.
>
> _**He** kuo **báq** koruo._{:.t}<br>
> (As a rule,) **ravens** are black.

In English, the simple present tense very often expresses generic claims, but we don't even think about it. You may be tempted to translate "I like movies" into _Cho jí báq kıq_{:.t}, but this Toaq sentence only claims an _episode_ of you doing some movie-liking at some point in time. It's more correct to say _He cho jí báq kıq_{:.t}, which is properly generic.

<summary>How do generic claims work?</summary>

Generics are the subject of much debate in the world of semantics, even though people seem to have clear intuitions for them.

"Ticks carry Lyme disease" sounds true, even though only a small percentage of ticks ever carry the disease. Meanwhile, "people are right-handed" sounds intuitively wrong, even though most people really are right-handed. How can we make sense of these apparent contradictions?

Some linguists posit a "generic operator" that is cognitively primal — perhaps it can be identified with whatever cognitive function allows humans to stereotype and form biases.

The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy offers an overview of this topic in its article on [_Generic Generalizations_](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/generics/), but it's not an easy read. Whatever lies at the heart of generics, _he_{:.t} and _báq_{:.t} are Toaq's way of tapping into it.
