## Story

Náo just finished explaining a complicated job to Tóma. She asks...

{:.tone-figure}
_Ína,_{:.t2} _ínha?_{:.t2}

And Tóma shows that he understood, and will do as she asked:

{:.tone-figure}
_Nho,_{:.t1} _ına._{:.t1} _Inha._{:.t1}

While he's working on the job, Tóma cries out:

{:.tone-figure}
_Ahı!_{:.t1}

Náo worries that he's hurt — then rushes over and sees the papercut on his hand.

_Áhı?_{:.t2} ... _Âhı._{:.t4}

## Tones

Toaq is a **tonal** language. The **tone mark** on the first vowel of a word indicates a change in pronunciation and meaning. We can find three different tone marks in the story above.

Toaq words are pronounced with stress on the first syllable, and tone continuing over the whole word.

{:.tone-figure style="text-align:center;"}
| If a word doesn't have any tone mark, it's in the **falling tone**. | If a word has an **accent** (´)  on the first vowel, it's in the **rising tone**. | If a word has a **caret** (^) on the first vowel, it's in the **hiatus tone**. |
| _ahı_{:.t1 style="line-height:4"} | _áhı_{:.t2} | _âhı_{:.t4} |

The hiatus tone is a bit special, because it makes the first vowel of a word longer, as if to make room for the rise and the fall. So, _âhı_{:.t} is pronounced a bit like _á-ahı_{:.t}.

Parts of speech are affected differently by the tones. We can see from this story that the rising tone turns an interjection into a question, while the hiatus tone turns it into a sort of expression of empathy. But further in the book, we'll see that (for example) the rising tone turns verbs into nouns, and the hiatus tone turns them into adverbs.

Whenever some grammatical quality is expressed through tone, we'll make a note of it. For now, just remember the three tone marks.

## Dealing with tones

In the next chapters, take care to practice reading words _with the correct tone_, as indicated by the tone marks.

{:.tone-figure}
_Choa_{:.t1} _súq_{:.t2} _ní_{:.t2} _kuna_{:.t1} _dûe_{:.t4} _ba._{:.t1}

(That means: "pronounce this sentence correctly.")

Don't worry too much about doing it perfectly. Producing the tones exactly right is less important than simply being _aware_ of them. If Toaq is your first tonal language, it may take a bit of getting used to, but they're not something you have to master before engaging with the rest of the language.

<details class="aside grammar" markdown="1">
<summary>Syntactic and lexical tone</summary>
Generally speaking, the role of tone is _syntactic_, not _lexical_. _Due_{:.t} and _dûe_{:.t} mean "correct" and "correctly", respectively, rather than being completely different dictionary words.

There is a little bit of _lexical tone_ in Toaq as well: _na_{:.t} is an interjection meaning "well", whereas _nâ_{:.t} is a little verb meaning "to be such that." In fact, the tonal patterns found among Toaq's interjections are vague enough to say that _nho, nhó, zı, zí_{:.t} are all just different lexemes.
