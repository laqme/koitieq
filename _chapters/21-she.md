<summary>Toaq and cats</summary>

Toaqists love cats. The most upvoted word in the community dictionary is _nhaq_{:.t}, which means _meow_. Perhaps this is only natural for a language that grew on the internet? Perhaps we can imagine Toaqgua is similarly crazy about cats? Whatever the case, Toaq has dozens of words for cat-related things. Here is just a sample.

| Word | Meaning |

|  _roro_{:.t} | purr |
|  _nhaqdı_{:.t} | hewwo, meowdy |

## Saying "if" in Toaq

The basic pattern for saying "if X then Y" in Toaq is: _shê, ꝡä X, nä Y_{:.t}.

Both X and Y are clauses, and can contain a tense word.

> _**Shê, ꝡä** seo súq Élıza, **nä** ruaı súq._{:.t}<br>
> **If** you're married to Eliza, **then** you're royalty.
>
> _Sá cıoq nä, **shê, ꝡä** naı dem jí cíoq, **nä** notuq ké kea._{:.t}<br>
> There's a button that, **if** I press it, the machine explodes.
>
> _Ma **shê, ꝡä** mala choq jí Tóaqzu, **nä** poq jua jí móq?_{:.t}<br>
> Is it true that, **if** I've ever used Toaq, I'm a weird person?

You can also just say _she Y_{:.t}, leaving the condition implicit.

> _**She** jıa cho súq ní nha._{:.t}<br>
> (If so-and-so, then) you'll like this.

## Possibility vs. necessity

The word _shê_{:.t} means expresses a _conditional necessity_. We use it to say: in _all_ worlds (cases) where X is true, Y is true.

If we use _dâı_{:.t} instead of _shê_{:.t}, we can express a mere _possibility_: in _some_ worlds where X is true, Y is true.

(In other words, _shê_{:.t} is a bit like _tú_{:.t} and _dâı_{:.t} is a bit like _sá_{:.t}.)

> _**Dâı, ꝡä** fa súq Rédueq, **nä** geq súq Míqte._{:.t}<br>
> **If** you go to Rédueq, you **might** meet Míqte.<br>

Again, we can use it in the falling tone to leave the condition implicit.

> _**Daı** geq súq Míqte._{:.t}<br>
> You **might** meet Míqte.<br>

<summary>Possible worlds</summary>

A **possible world**, or simply **world**, is just _a way things could be_: a maximal situation. The Standford Encyclopedia of Philosophy has a lovely [introduction](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/possible-worlds/) (read the first two paragraphs).

Most Toaq sentences are about the real world: they ask "In the real world, is there some event…?" or they claim "In the real world, there exists some event…" But conditionals give us a way to quantify over other worlds: "If you were in Paris right now…" says something about all worlds, _minimally different_ from the real world, in which you are in Paris but everything else is pretty much the same.

Worlds pop up absolutely everywhere in Toaq semantics. We say that a Toaq clause represents a function from _worlds_ to _truth-values_. A clause _tı súq Párı_{:.t} represents a function _f_, where _f(w)_ is true if and only if you are in Paris in world _w_.

## If I were…

The words _shê/dâı_{:.t} have counterparts _âo/êa_{:.t}, which add the background information that the condition X is in fact _not_ met in the real world. Linguists call these _counterfactual_ or _subjunctive_ conditionals.

In English, this corresponds to conditional statements like "if you were…" or "if we had been…"

The word _ao_{:.t} expresses a counterfactual necessity:

> _**Âo**, ꝡä seo súq Élıza, nä ruaı súq._{:.t}<br>
> **If** you **were** married to Eliza, you would be royalty. (But you're not.)

And the word _ea_{:.t} expresses a counterfactual possibility:

> _**Ea** jaı jí._{:.t}<br>
> (If such-and-such **were** the case,) I could be happy. (But it's not.)

## The words _áq_{:.t} and _chéq_{:.t}

The word _áq_{:.t} means "yourself / herself / itself / themselves…" It refers to the (possibly plural) subject of the clause it's in.

The word _chéq_{:.t} means "each other". It refers back to the subject, but specifically it relates members of a plural subject to each other.

> _Kıaı ké sımı áq._{:.t}<br>
> The monkeys take care of themselves.
>
> _Kıaı ké sımı **chéq**._{:.t}<br>
> The monkeys take care of **each other**.

Note that the first sentence here means: "the monkeys (together) take care of the monkeys (together)" — not necessarily implying that each monkey takes care of itself. The group acts as a group to take care of the group.

<details class="aside grammar" markdown="1">
<summary>The áq rule</summary>

There's a rule called the **áq rule**, saying that you _must_ use _áq_{:.t} when possible. Specifically: "variable" pronouns like _hó_{:.t} and _máq_{:.t} can't refer to the subject of the clause they're in.

In the first sentence below, **hó** doesn't refer to **ké naq**. The áq rule tells us that, if the speaker meant that, they would've said _áq_{:.t}. (Think about how in English, it sounds weird to say _him_ instead of _himself_.)

> _Aojaı ké lıq, ꝡá cho ké naq **hó**._{:.t}<br>
> The girl wants the guy to like **her**.
>
> _Aojaı ké lıq, ꝡá cho ké naq **áq**._{:.t}<br>
> The girl wants the guy to like **himself**.
