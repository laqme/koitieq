## Numbers

Toaq numbers are made from the following words:

| Word | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| _koam_{:.t} | zero |
| _shı_{:.t} | one |
| _gu_{:.t} | two |
| _saq_{:.t} | three |
| _jo_{:.t} | four |
| _fe_{:.t} | five |
| _cı_{:.t} | six |
| _dıaı_{:.t} | seven |
| _roaı_{:.t} | eight |
| _neı_{:.t} | nine |
| _heı_{:.t} | ten |

In the falling tone, a number acts like a **counting verb** or adjective:

> _fe_{:.t}<br>▯ are five in number
>
> _**Neı** ké chaıbıo._{:.t}<br>
> The teacups **are nine**.
>
> _Cho jí ké lua **gu**._{:.t}<br>
> I like the **two** stories.

In the rising tone by itself, it refers to an **abstract quantity**:

> _fé_{:.t}<br>the number five
>
> _Reutoaı **sáq**._{:.t}<br>
> **Three** is a prime number.

In the rising tone and followed by a verb, it acts as a **determiner**:

> _fé kue_{:.t}<br>five books
>
> _Zudeq jí **jó** zu._{:.t}<br>
> I speak **four** languages.

<summary>Plural logic</summary>

Toaq is built on **plural logic**. A plural variable can refer not just to a thing, but to _things_. For example, when we turn _The teacups are nine_ into a formula, we might say that _xx_ _are_ teacups, and _xx_ _are_ nine. We don't need to talk about a _set_ of nine teacups.

Plural logic helps explain natural language sentences like "the students gathered and ate." It's hard to account for such sentence using singular logic: surely we can't say that an individual student gathered, nor is it tempting to say that a _set_ did any eating.

If we embrace plurality from the ground up in our logic, and say "_xx_ are students, and _xx_ gathered, and _xx_ ate," we can let the predicates themselves decide what to do with those plurals. Instead of talking about sets and membership, we take the relationship _xx are among yy_ (written _xx_ ≺ _yy_) as fundamental.

Toaq's _sá_{:.t} corresponds to a plural-domain existential quantifier ∃_xx_, so _sá poq_{:.t} means "for some people _xx_."

> _Kueq sá sıomche._{:.t}<br>
> Some students gathered.

But the common universal quantification we've been using, _tú_{:.t}, corresponds to the _singular_ universal ∀_x_, meaning "for each _x_." This just turns out to be what's convenient a lot of the time. It does mean that you can't say this:

> _Kueq tú sıomche._{:.t.bad}<br>
> Each student gathered.

There is another quantifier, _tútu_{:.t}, corresponding to ∀_xx_. So _tútu poq_{:.t} means "for any person or people _xx_," but it doesn't seem to come up often in everyday speech.

> _Tútu poq nä geo sóq sá mea póq._{:.t}<br>
> For any people, someone among them is the oldest.

More useful is _túq_{:.t}, an article that means something closer to _all_ than to _each_. The phrase _túq poq_{:.t} "all the people" refers to some _tt_ that are people, where for any _xx_ that are also people, _xx_ are _among_ _tt_. In other words, it refers to the maximal plurality of _poq_{:.t}.

> _Kueq túq sıomche._{:.t}<br>
> All students gathered.

All this to say: when we use a number as a determiner, it means the same thing as _sá_{:.t} plus a counting verb, which is to claim the existence of a plurality while restricting its number.

> _Kueq héı sıomche._{:.t}<br>
> _Kueq sá sıomche heı._{:.t}<br>
> Ten students gathered.<br>
> <small>∃xx: student(xx) and ten(xx) and gather(xx)</small>

## Counting higher

| Word | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| _heı_{:.t} | ten |
| _guheı_{:.t} | twenty |
| _guheı shı_{:.t} | twenty-one |
| _fue_{:.t} | 100 |
| _saqfue heı_{:.t} | 310 |
| _saqfue guheı_{:.t} | 320 |
| _saqfue cı_{:.t} | 306 |

The "tens" are compounds with _heı_{:.t}, and "hundreds" are compounds with _fue_{:.t}. We put these parts next to each other to add them together. For example, 234 is _gúfue saqheı jo_{:.t} (two-hundred thirty four). Only the first word gets the rising tone:

{:.tone-figure}
_gúfue_{:.t2} _saqheı_{:.t1} _jo_{:.t1}

<details class="aside semantics" markdown="1">
<summary>Advanced numbers</summary>

To count even higher, we use the following "thousands separator" words:

| Word | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| _bıq_{:.t} | thousand |
| _nhoeı_{:.t} | million |
| _gıga_{:.t} | billion |
| _tera_{:.t} | trillion |

If there's no number before the thousands-word, _shí_{:.t} is implied.

> _gúheı saq bıq jofue feheı cı_{:.t}<br>
> twenty-three thousand, four-hundred and fifty-six (23,456)
>
> _nhóeı neıfue bıq_{:.t}<br>
> one million, nine-hundred thousand (1,900,000)

The word _co_{:.t} is a spoken decimal point.

> _gú co saq koam jo_{:.t}<br>
> two point three zero four (2.304)

## Dates

The names of the months are formed by adding _jue_{:.t} to the numbers 1 through 12.

| Word | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| _shıjue_{:.t} | ▯ is a January |
| _gujue_{:.t} | ▯ is a February |
| _saqjue_{:.t} | ▯ is a March  |
| _jojue_{:.t} | ▯ is an April |
| _fejue_{:.t} | ▯ is a May |
| _cıjue_{:.t} | ▯ is a June |
| _dıaıjue_{:.t} | ▯ is a July |
| _roaıjue_{:.t} | ▯ is an August |
| _neıjue_{:.t} | ▯ is a September |
| _heıjue_{:.t} | ▯ is an October |
| _heıshıjue_{:.t} | ▯ is a November |
| _heıgujue_{:.t} | ▯ is a December |

By combining number words with _chaq_{:.t}, we get words for the days of the month:

| Word | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| _fechaq_{:.t} | ▯ is a 5th of the month |
| _saqheıshıchaq_{:.t} | ▯ is a 31th of the month |

You can talk about dates like so:

> _Rao ké patı **ké fechaq po ké saqjue**._{:.t}<br>
> The party is on the 5th of March.

There's also this alternative set of month names, where each month's name is a little alliterative vignette.

| _luqluoq_{:.t} | February (Calmstead) |
| _ırue'ısıe_{:.t} | March (Galegrace) |

| _suaqsoq_{:.t} | May (Songpeak) |

| _nharunhuo_{:.t} | July (Stormful) |
| _shuaqshoa_{:.t} | August (Richdeep) |
| _reoruq_{:.t} | September (Huefall) |
| _feafao_{:.t} | October (Bravestop) |
