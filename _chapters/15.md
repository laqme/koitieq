## Numbers

Toaq numbers are made from the following words:

| Word | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| _koam_{:.t} | zero |
| _shı_{:.t} | one |
| _gu_{:.t} | two |
| _saq_{:.t} | three |
| _jo_{:.t} | four |
| _fe_{:.t} | five |
| _cı_{:.t} | six |
| _dıaı_{:.t} | seven |
| _roaı_{:.t} | eight |
| _neı_{:.t} | nine |
| _heı_{:.t} | ten |

In the falling tone, a number acts like a **counting verb** or adjective:

> _fe_{:.t}<br>▯ are five in number
>
> _**Neı** ké chaıbıo._{:.t}<br>
> The teacups **are nine**.
>
> _Cho jí ké lua **gu**._{:.t}<br>
> I like the **two** stories.

In the rising tone by itself, it refers to an **abstract quantity**:

> _fé_{:.t}<br>the number five
>
> _Reutoaı **sáq**._{:.t}<br>
> **Three** is a prime number.

In the rising tone and followed by a verb, it acts as a **determiner**:

> _fé kue_{:.t}<br>five books
>
> _Zudeq jí **jó** zu._{:.t}<br>
> I speak **four** languages.

<summary>Plural logic</summary>

Toaq is built on **plural logic**. We say a variable can refer to _things_, plural. For example, when we turn _"The teacups are nine"_ into a formula, we might say: _xx_ _are_ teacups, and _xx_ _are_ nine. We don't need to talk about a "set" of nine teacups.

Plural logic helps explain natural language sentences like "the students gathered and ate." It's hard to account for such sentence using singular logic: surely we can't say that an individual student gathered, nor is it tempting to say that a _set_ did any eating.

If we embrace plurality from the ground up in our logic, and say "_xx_ are students, and _xx_ gathered, and _xx_ ate," we can let the predicates themselves decide what to do with those plurals. Instead of talking about sets and membership, we take the relationship _xx are among yy_ (written _xx_ ≺ _yy_) as fundamental.

All this is why _fe_{:.t} can just mean: "▯ _are_ five in number."

<summary>A plural tour of quantifiers</summary>
Toaq's _sá_{:.t} corresponds to a plural existential quantifier ∃_xx_, so _sá poq_{:.t} means "for some people _xx_."

> _Kueq sá sıomche._{:.t}<br>
> Some students gathered.<br>
> <small>∃xx: student(xx) and gather(xx)</small>

But the common universal quantification we've been using, _tú_{:.t}, corresponds to the _singular_ universal ∀_x_, meaning "for each _x_." This just turns out to be what's convenient a lot of the time. However, it does mean that you can't meaningfully say:

> _Kueq tú sıomche._{:.t.bad}<br>
> Each student gathered.<br>
> <small>∀x: student(x) and gather(x)</small>

There is another quantifier, _tútu_{:.t}, corresponding to ∀_xx_. So _tútu poq_{:.t} means "for any person or people _xx_," but it doesn't seem to come up often in everyday speech.

> _Tútu poq nä, joaq sá mea póq póq._{:.t}<br>
> For any people, some among them is the leader of them.<br>
> <small>[∀xx: people(xx)] [∃yy: yy ≺ xx] leader(yy, xx)</small>


More useful is _túq_{:.t}, an article which means something closer to _all_ than to _each_. The phrase _túq poq_{:.t} "all people" refers to some _tt_ that are people, where, for any _xx_ that are also people, _xx_ ≺ _tt_. In other words, it refers to the maximal plurality of _poq_{:.t}.

> _Kueq túq sıomche._{:.t}<br>
> All students gathered.<br>
> <small>[∃tt: student(tt)] gather(tt), and [∀xx: student(xx)] xx ≺ tt</small>

All this to say: when we use a number as a determiner, it means the same thing as _sá_{:.t} plus a counting verb, which is to claim the existence of some plural _xx_ while restricting its number.

> _Kueq héı sıomche._{:.t}<br>
> _Kueq sá sıomche heı._{:.t}<br>
> Ten students gathered.<br>
> <small>∃xx: student(xx) and ten(xx) and gather(xx)</small>

This means that _Zudeq jí shí zu_{:.t} means "I speak a language" and not "I speak exactly one language."

## Counting higher

| Word | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| _heı_{:.t} | ten |
| _guheı_{:.t} | twenty |
| _guheı shı_{:.t} | twenty-one |
| _fue_{:.t} | 100 |
| _saqfue heı_{:.t} | 310 |
| _saqfue guheı_{:.t} | 320 |
| _saqfue cı_{:.t} | 306 |

The "tens" are compounds with _heı_{:.t}, and "hundreds" are compounds with _fue_{:.t}. We put these parts next to each other to add them together. For example, 234 is _gúfue saqheı jo_{:.t} (two-hundred thirty four). Only the first word gets the rising tone:

{:.tone-figure}
_gúfue_{:.t2} _saqheı_{:.t1} _jo_{:.t1}

<audio controls class="center-audio"><source src="../assets/audio/gufue-saqhei-jo.mp3"></audio>

<details class="aside semantics" markdown="1">
<summary>Advanced numbers</summary>

To count even higher, we use the following "thousands separator" words:

| Word | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| _bıq_{:.t} | thousand |
| _nhoeı_{:.t} | million |
| _gıga_{:.t} | billion |
| _tera_{:.t} | trillion |

If there's no number before the thousands-word, _shí_{:.t} is implied.

> _gúheı saq bıq jofue feheı cı_{:.t}<br>
> twenty-three thousand, four-hundred and fifty-six (23,456)
>
> _nhóeı neıfue bıq_{:.t}<br>
> one million, nine-hundred thousand (1,900,000)

The word _co_{:.t} is a spoken decimal point.

> _gú co saq koam jo_{:.t}<br>
> two point three zero four (2.304)

## Dates

The names of the months are formed by adding _jue_{:.t} to the numbers 1 through 12.

| Word | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| _shıjue_{:.t} | ▯ is a January |
| _gujue_{:.t} | ▯ is a February |
| _saqjue_{:.t} | ▯ is a March  |
| _jojue_{:.t} | ▯ is an April |
| _fejue_{:.t} | ▯ is a May |
| _cıjue_{:.t} | ▯ is a June |
| _dıaıjue_{:.t} | ▯ is a July |
| _roaıjue_{:.t} | ▯ is an August |
| _neıjue_{:.t} | ▯ is a September |
| _heıjue_{:.t} | ▯ is an October |
| _heıshıjue_{:.t} | ▯ is a November |
| _heıgujue_{:.t} | ▯ is a December |

By combining number words with _chaq_{:.t}, we get words for the days of the month:

| Word | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| _fechaq_{:.t} | ▯ is a 5th of the month |
| _saqheıshıchaq_{:.t} | ▯ is a 31th of the month |

You can talk about dates like so:

> _Rao ké patı **ké fechaq po ké saqjue**._{:.t}<br>
> The party is on the 5th of March.

There's also this alternative set of month names, where each month's name is an alliteration based on nature or the month's "role" in the year — the English back-translations below are just to give you an idea.

| Word | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| _chıochu_{:.t} | January – _Newheart_ |
| _luqluoq_{:.t} | February – _Calmstead_ |
| _ırue'ısıe_{:.t} | March – _Galegrace_ |
| _geagom_{:.t} | April – _Hightorch_ |
| _suaqsoq_{:.t} | May – _Songpeak_ |
| _nuoqnea_{:.t} | June – _Mirrorwide_ |
| _nharunhuo_{:.t} | July – _Stormful_ |
| _shuaqshoa_{:.t} | August – _Giftdeep_ |
| _reoruq_{:.t} | September – _Huefall_ |
| _feafao_{:.t} | October – _Bravestop_ |
| _hoehıu_{:.t} | November – _Sunbrook_ |
| _cuaocoa_{:.t} | December – _Passbridge_ |
