## Numbers

Toaq numbers are made from the following words:

| Word | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| _koam_{:.t} | zero |
| _shı_{:.t} | one |
| _gu_{:.t} | two |
| _saq_{:.t} | three |
| _jo_{:.t} | four |
| _fe_{:.t} | five |
| _cı_{:.t} | six |
| _dıaı_{:.t} | seven |
| _roaı_{:.t} | eight |
| _neı_{:.t} | nine |
| _heı_{:.t} | ten |

In the falling tone, a number acts like a **counting verb**:

> _fe_{:.t}<br>▯ are five in number
>
> _**Neı** ké chaıbıo._{:.t}<br>
> The teacups **are nine** (i.e., there are nine of them.)
>
> _Cho jí ké lua **gu**._{:.t}<br>
> I like the **two** stories.

In the rising tone, it refers to an abstract **quantity**:

> _fé_{:.t}<br>the number five
>
> _Reutoaı **sáq**._{:.t}<br>
> **Three** is a prime number.

But, in the rising tone followed by a verb, it acts as a **determiner**:

> _fé kue_{:.t}<br>five books
>
> _Zudeq jí **jó** zu._{:.t}<br>
> I speak **four** languages.

## Counting higher

| Word | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| _heı_{:.t} | ten |
| _guheı_{:.t} | twenty |
| _guheı shı_{:.t} | twenty-one |
| _fue_{:.t} | 100 |
| _saqfue heı_{:.t} | 310 |
| _saqfue guheı_{:.t} | 320 |
| _saqfue cı_{:.t} | 306 |

The "tens" are compounds with _heı_{:.t}, and "hundreds" are compounds with _fue_{:.t}. We put these parts next to each other to add them together. For example, 234 is _gúfue saqheı jo_{:.t} (two-hundred thirty four). Only the first word gets the rising tone:

{:.tone-figure}
_gúfue_{:.t2} _saqheı_{:.t1} _jo_{:.t1}

To count even higher, we use the following "thousands separator" words:

| Word | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| _bıq_{:.t} | thousand |
| _nhoeı_{:.t} | million |
| _gıga_{:.t} | billion |
| _tera_{:.t} | trillion |

If there's no number before the thousands-word, _shí_{:.t} is implied.

> _gúheı saq bıq jofue feheı cı_{:.t}<br>
> twenty-three thousand, four-hundred and fifty-six (23,456)
>
> _nhóeı neıfue bıq_{:.t}<br>
> one million, nine-hundred thousand (1,900,000)

The word _co_{:.t} is a spoken decimal point.

> _gú co saq koam jo_{:.t}<br>
> two point three zero four (2.304)

## Dates

The names of the months are formed by adding _jue_{:.t} to the numbers 1 through 12.

| Word | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| _shıjue_{:.t} | ▯ is a January |
| _gujue_{:.t} | ▯ is a February |
| _saqjue_{:.t} | ▯ is a March  |
| _jojue_{:.t} | ▯ is an April |
| _fejue_{:.t} | ▯ is a May |
| _cıjue_{:.t} | ▯ is a June |
| _dıaıjue_{:.t} | ▯ is a July |
| _roaıjue_{:.t} | ▯ is an August |
| _neıjue_{:.t} | ▯ is a September |
| _heıjue_{:.t} | ▯ is an October |
| _heıshıjue_{:.t} | ▯ is a November |
| _heıgujue_{:.t} | ▯ is a December |

By combining number words with _chaq_{:.t}, we get words for the days of the month:

| Word | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| _fechaq_{:.t} | ▯ is a 5th of the month |
| _saqheıshıchaq_{:.t} | ▯ is a 31th of the month |

You can talk about dates like so:

> _Rao ké patı **ké fechaq po ké saqjue**._{:.t}<br>
> The party is on the 5th of March.
