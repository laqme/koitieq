## Diphthongs
When a word contains multiple successive vowels, they are usually pronounced as separate syllables. For example, _Toaq_{:.t} is pronounced /to.aŋ/ and _kua_{:.t} as /ku.a/.

The following four combinations of vowels are exceptions to this:

| Letters | Pronunciation |
| ------- | ------------- |
| aı | \[aj\] (as in _b**ye**_) |
| ao | \[aw\] (as in _n**ow**_) |
| eı | \[ej\] (as in _w**eigh**_) |
| oı | \[oj\] (as in _b**oy**_) |

## Pronouncing _ꝡ_{:.t}
The pronunciation of the consonant _ꝡ_{:.t} depends on the vowel that comes before it.

- After _e_{:.t} or _ı_{:.t}, it's pronounced \[w\] (as in _**w**et_).
- After _o_{:.t} or _u_{:.t}, it's pronounced \[j\] (as in _**y**et_).
- Elsewhere, either pronunciation is fine.

One way to think of this is that _ꝡ_{:.t} wants you to move your lips. After _e_{:.t} or _ı_{:.t}, they are already in the position to say [j], so _ꝡ_{:.t} wants you to say [w] instead! And after saying _o_{:.t} or _u_{:.t}, your mouth is ready to say [w], so if there's a _ꝡ_{:.t} coming up, it wants you to _move_ your mouth and say [j].

<summary>Closed syllables</summary>
A finer point of Toaq pronunciation is that vowels before _q_{:.t} are pronounced slightly shorter and more "closed" than other vowels. For example, the syllable _gu_{:.t} is pronounced [guː] and _gum_{:.t} is pronounced [guːm], but _guq_{:.t} is pronounced [gʊŋ].

## Deranı

Toaq has a "native" writing system called _Déranı_{:.t}. It's not used in this textbook, because the Latin script is what gets used more in daily life. It looks like this:
