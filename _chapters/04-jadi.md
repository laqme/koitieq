<details class="aside culture" markdown="1">
<summary>Toaqgua</summary>
A bit of worldbuilding can really tie a conlang together. It's nice to imagine the place where the conlang is spoken as a vivid environment with its own people and culture. How would they use Toaq? What words or registers or forms of poetry would they invent?

When we imagine Toaq being spoken somewhere, we often think of _Tóaqgua_{:.t}, a fictional country somewhere between Southeast Asia, Lojbanistan, and Atlantis. _Sáqmeı_{:.t} and _Rédueq_{:.t} are equally fictional cities within this country.

## Verb, subject, object

The basic structure of a Toaq sentence is: verb, subject, object. The conversation above consists of such sentences and interjections, such as _jadı_{:.t} _hello_ and  _kushe_{:.t} _sorry_, which may occur mostly anywhere. They are italicized in the text to help you spot them.

Toaq does not distinguish between verbs, nouns, and adjectives in its dictionary. Compare these three sentences:

> _Sıomche jí._{:.t} \
> I am a student.
>
> _Naq jí._{:.t} \
> I am male.
>
> _Gom jí._{:.t} \
> I make a mistake.

If you look these words up in a Toaq dictionary, they'll look like this:

> _sıomche_{:.t} — ▯ is a student \
> _naq_{:.t} — ▯ is male \
> _gom_{:.t} — ▯ makes a mistake

Only English differentiates the parts of speech here. From Toaq's perspective, these are all _verbs_. (The verb _sıomche_{:.t} means, _to be a student_).

Each of these verbs has a "hole" or "slot" (▯) in its definition. To make a complete sentence, you say the verb, and then a _subject_ to fill the slot.

Now compare these sentences:

> _Sıom jí Tóaqzu._{:.t} \
> I study Toaq.
>
> _Bua jí Sáqmeı._{:.t} \
> I live in Saqmeı.
>
> _Tıjuı Sáqmeı Rédueq._{:.t} \
> Saqmeı is nearby Redueq.

Again, let's look up these words in a Toaq dictionary.

> _sıom_{:.t} — ▯ studies ▯. \
> _bua_{:.t} — ▯ lives in ▯. \
> _tıjuı_{:.t} — ▯ is nearby ▯.

These verbs are have _two_ slots. To make a sentence, you say the verb, and then fill both slots: a subject and an object.

<div class="aside grammar" markdown="1">
Verbs with one slot are also called _intransitive_. Verbs with two slots are _transitive_.
</div>

<details class="aside grammar" markdown="1">
<summary>Underfilling</summary>
In Toaq, you're not allowed to "underfill" a verb. _Tıjuı jí_{:.t} is not a valid sentence. Coming from other loglangs, this may come as a surprise. Basically, it's not clear if _Tıjuı jí_{:.t} should mean "I'm near something" or "I'm near it" or something else. So, in Toaq, we prefer just fill the object with an explicit pronoun or determiner.

> _Tıjuı jí máq._{:.t}<br>
> I'm nearby it.
>
> _Tıjuı jí sá raı._{:.t}<br>
> I'm nearby something.
</details>

## Nouns and tone

Have you been paying attention to the tone marks? For now, all our nouns are _proper nouns_: _Tóaqzu_{:.t}, _Míqte_{:.t}, _Sáqmeı_{:.t}, and so on.

Notice that these are all in the *rising tone*, as are personal pronouns: _jí_{:.t} (me) and _súq_{:.t} (you). The basic rule is that verbs are in the falling tone, and their participants --- nouns --- are in the rising tone.
