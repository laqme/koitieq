## Predicatizers

Some Toaq verbs consume a following noun and then act like a one-slot verb. Such verbs are called **predicatizers**.

(The logic behind this name is that logicians call verbs _predicates_, and so a predicatizer turns the following noun into a predicate.)

For example, _po **noun**{:.v}_{:.t} means "▯ is of / is associated with **noun**{:.v}." It expresses a pretty general relation between the eventual subject and the _predicatized_ noun.

> _po jí_{:.t}<br>
> ▯ is mine
>
> _Fıeq jí sá **po Tóaqzu**._{:.t}<br>
> I make **some Toaq stuff**.
>
> _**Po báq dıu** ní kue._{:.t} <small>&emsp;(= _Bẹdıu ní kue_{:.t})</small><br>
> This book **is of (about) science**.

Predicatizers don't bind a variable like _pó_{:.t}. Instead, _pó **noun**{:.v}_{:.t} is short for _báq po **noun**{:.v}_{:.t}. You often see _pó_{:.t} used as a way to _inexactly refer_ to a noun, meaning "stuff about X" or "things involving X".

> _Dua jí **pó Ísıkuızu**._{:.t}<br>
> I know **Ithkuil things**.

Another useful predicatizer is _seq **noun**{:.v}_{:.t}, which means "▯ is something other than **noun**{:.v}." (It's basically _bu eq ▯ **noun**{:.v}_{:.t} in predicatizer form.)

> _seq báq kıachaq_{:.t}<br>
> ▯ is not a Monday
>
> _Tú choaq **seq jí** nä, chum geı hóa sá chea._{:.t}<br>
> Every guest **but me** is wearing a hat.

This last sentence shows that predicatizers can be used as adjectives, too.

<details class="aside grammar" markdown="1">
<summary>Predicatizers and scope</summary>

Predicatizers make a tiny scope island. You can think of _po tú gua_{:.t} as a verb meaning "▯ is of each country", rather than its _tú_{:.t} applying a "for each country X…" to the whole clause it's in.

> <center><div class="scope t"><span class="sb"><i>Ꝡa</i></span> ca <b>sá patı</b> <div class="scope t s2"><span class="sb"><i>po</i></span> <b>tú gua</b></div> <b>sá choeq</b> da.</div><br><small><b>Some</b> party (that's) <b>of-every-country</b> caused <b>some</b> commotion.</small></center>

The _po_{:.t} constrains the scope of the _tú_{:.t}, and so this sentence _doesn't_ mean anything like: "for each country X, some party-of-X caused some commotion."

<details class="aside semantics" markdown="1">
<summary>Masses, <i class="t">mea</i>, and <i class="t">mem</i></summary>

It's easy to confuse plural constants with "words that mean a group." The word _mea_{:.t} can say something is _among_ a plurality, but it doesn't know anything about the parts we might see if we look "inside" the noun.

For example: if _múaome_{:.t} refers to some forest(s), then _tú mea múaome_{:.t} means "each of the forests". It doesn't mean "each of the trees"! A forest is an example of a _mass_ — as far as plurality goes, it's one _thing_, even though it has parts on the inside.

This may seem obvious, but the same applies to words like _ké poqme_{:.t} "the group of people", where it's a far easier mistake to make. The phrase _tú mea ké poqme_{:.t} means "every (group) among the groups of people." It does not mean "every person in the group."

To refer to parts that make up groups, there's the predicatizer _mem **noun**{:.v}_{:.t}, which means "▯ is among _the parts forming_ **noun**{:.v}". So _tú mem ké poqme_{:.t} refers to "every person in the group" and _tú mem ké muaome_{:.t} refers to "every tree in the forest."

## "Among" with _mea_{:.t}

The predicatizer _mea **noun**{:.v}_{:.t} means "▯ is among **noun**{:.v}":

> _mea ké kuepaq_{:.t}<br>
> ▯ is among the chapters
>
> _**Mea ké kuepaq** jí._{:.t}<br>
> I am **among the chapters**.

<!-- ## Amongness

In Toaq, nouns refer to "possibly plural" entities that relate to each other by the _amongness_ relation. For example, _ké chıeche_{:.t} refers to _the students_, and we can say things like…

> _**Mea ké chıeche** jí._{:.t}<br>
> I am **among the students**.

> _**Mea ké chıeche** úmo._{:.t}<br>
> You and I **are among the students**.

(See the note in chapter 15 about _Plural logic_ for more information.)

This relationship can also be expressed with _meaga_{:.t} "▯ is among ▯" instead of the predicatizer _mea_{:.t}.

> _**Meaga** úmo ké chıeche._{:.t}<br>
> You and I **are among** the students.

This is also true:

> _Mea jí jí._{:.t}<br>
> I am among me. -->

An especially useful construction is: article + _mea_{:.t} + noun. It lets us say things like "some of these", "each of the", "many of those", and so on.

> _Mala noaq jí sá mea ké kuepaq._{:.t}<br>
> I've read some of the chapters.
>
> _Zao jí tú mea ní laı._{:.t}<br>
> I know all of these letters.

<details class="aside semantics" markdown="1">
<summary>Distributivity</summary>

For many verbs, there is no difference between _**verb**{:.v} nhána_{:.t} and _**verb**{:.v} tú mea nhána_{:.t}. "The children are happy" means nothing more than that each child is happy.

> _Jaı ké deo._{:.t}<br>
> The children are happy.
>
> _Jaı **tú mea ké** deo._{:.t}<br>
> **Each of the** children is happy.

Such verbs are called **distributive**. But not all verbs are distributive. Consider the following pair of sentences:

> _Reı ké rua ké pıo._{:.t}<br>
> The flowers surround the rock.
>
> _Reı **tú mea ké** rua ké pıo._{:.t.bad}<br>
> **Each of the** flowers surrounds the rock.

The second sentence doesn't make a lot of sense. "Surrounding the rock" is something the flowers do _together_. We say that _reı_{:.t} is **non-distributive**, at least in its subject.

## Superlatives with _sóq_{:.t}

The word _sóq_{:.t} has the same grammar as _kú_{:.t} and _béı_{:.t} from lesson 14.

A sentence containing _sóq X_{:.t} means: "X is what (rest of sentence) the most."

> _Cho **sóq nháo** ní lua._{:.t}<br>
> **She** liked this story **the most** (more than anyone else likes it).
>
> _Cho nháo **sóq ní lua**._{:.t}<br>
> She liked **this story the most** (more than other stories).

These particles are called **focus particles**. Here are some other useful ones:

| Word | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| _kú **X**{:.v}_{:.t} | **X**{:.v} (is what…) |
| _béı **X**{:.v}_{:.t} | **X**{:.v} (not Y!) |
| _tó **X**{:.v}_{:.t} | only **X**{:.v} |
| _máo **X**{:.v}_{:.t} | also **X**{:.v} |
| _júaq **X**{:.v}_{:.t} | even **X**{:.v} |
| _shúq **X**{:.v}_{:.t} | merely **X**{:.v} |
| _sóq **X**{:.v}_{:.t} | **X**{:.v} the most |
| _súı **X**{:.v}_{:.t} | **X**{:.v} the least |
| _séu **X**{:.v}_{:.t} | **X**{:.v} if nothing else |
| _cúom **X**{:.v}_{:.t} | f\*$%ing **X**{:.v} |

Eek! Don't tell anyone I taught you that last one.
