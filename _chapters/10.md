## Adverbs

When we say a single-slot verb in the hiatus tone, it becomes an adverb. Adverbs go right after the verb, or at the end of the clause.

> _Kaq jí ké toa **jîm**._{:.t} / _Kaq **jîm** jí ké toa._{:.t}<br>
> I look at the words **briefly**.
>
> _Marao jí **jâı**._{:.t} / _Marao **jâı** jí._{:.t}<br>
> I dance **happily**.

Remember the tones? _Jâı_{:.t} is pronounced as two syllables, like "já-àı."

_Marao_{:.t.t1} _jí_{:.t.t2} _jâı._{:.t.t4} / _Marao_{:.t.t1} _jâı_{:.t.t4} _jí._{:.t.t2}

I dance happily.

<summary>Tonal morphemes</summary>

The hiatus tone is a **tonal morpheme**: basically, an invisible word, pronounced not as consonants and vowels, but by changing the tone of the next word. On some level, it makes sense to picture the hiatus tone coming "before" the word _jaı_{:.t}:

> _Marao jí **^ jaı**._{:.t} / _Marao **^ jaı** jí._{:.t}<br>
> I dance **happily**.

We can think of ^ as a particle that you put before a verb to make an adverb. And this perspective becomes sensible when we consider how to turn a multi-word verb into an adverb. Consider _jaq jaı_{:.t}, which contains the degree word _jaq_{:.t} "very":

> _Marao jí **jâq jaı**._{:.t} / _Marao **jâq jaı** jí._{:.t}<br>
> I dance **very happily**.

The underlying structure is now _^ jaq jaı_{:.t}, and so it is **jaq**'s tone that gets modified.

## Eventive vs. subject-sharing

In _marao jí **jâı**_{:.t}, it's me who's happy, but in _kaq jí ké toa **jîm**_{:.t}, it's not me who's brief. What's going on?

If the verb being turned into an adverb _can_ apply to events, the adverb is **eventive**, meaning it _applies to the event_ being described by that sentence.

> _Marao jí **jîm**._{:.t}<br>
> There is a me-dancing event _e_, and **_e_ is brief**.<br>
> (_jîm_{:.t} is eventive, because events can be brief.)

Otherwise, the adverb is **subject-sharing**, and it says what the subject is or does while participating in the event.

> _Marao jí **jâı**._{:.t}<br>
> There is a me-dancing event _e_, in which **I am happy**.<br>
> (_jâı_{:.t} is subject-sharing, because events can't be happy.)

## Prepositions

If the verb being turned into an adverb has two slots, then saying it in the hiatus tone will turn it into a **preposition**. The exact same rules apply as for adverbs, regarding their location and interpretation. The only difference is that a preposition has an **object** after it.

Prepositions can be eventive…

> _shıu_{:.t}<br>
> ▯ is before ▯
>
> _Marao jí **shîu ké nuaq**._{:.t}<br>
> I dance **before the night**.<br>
> There is a me-dancing event _e_, and **_e_ is before the night**.<br>(_shîu_{:.t} is eventive, because events can **shıu**.)

…or subject-sharing:

> _kaqsı_{:.t}<br>
> ▯ looks at ▯
>
> _Hıaı **kâqsı súq** jí._{:.t}<br>
> I laugh **looking at you**.<br>
> There is a me-laughing event _e_, in which **I look at you**.<br>
> (_kâqsı_{:.t} is subject-sharing, because events can't **kaqsı**.)
