## Politeness

There's no politeness "system" in Toaq, in the sense that you can use _súq_{:.t} with anyone, and you don't have to, say, conjugate your verbs differently. But pragmatically speaking, longer phrases tend to sound more polite, and some words have explicitly casual or formal connotations.

> _Ꝡadı._{:.t}<br>
> 'Sup.
>
> _Jadı._{:.t}<br>
> Hello.
>
> _Hıo jí súq ka._{:.t}<br>
> Good day. ("I hereby greet you.")

The sentence-ender _ka_{:.t} is for **performative** sentences — sentences that are true by virtue of you saying them. These often occur in the polite, "full phrase versions" of interjections.

> _Dıe jí nísıe hao ka._{:.t}<br>
> I hereby suggest the following.

## Saying goodbye

There are several ways to say goodbye in Toaq.

It's never wrong to say _baıbaı_{:.t} or _shaıdı_{:.t}, for example when you're parting ways or hanging up the phone.

If you're leaving for a while but you expect to see the other person again after, you say _oka_{:.t} (I'm departing) and the other person says _junı_{:.t} (ok, see you soon).

> _Oka, fa jí ké dıem._{:.t}<br>
> Be right back, I'm going to the store.
>
> _Junı, chıaısı súq ba._{:.t}<br>
> Okay, be careful.

If you're leaving indefinitely and you don't know when you'll meet again, you say _koıka_{:.t} (so long) and the other person says _reına_{:.t} (farewell).

> _Naı tıshaı jí súq ba. Koıka, hóı Méloa._{:.t}<br>
> I must leave you now. So long, Marigold.
>
> _Reına. Moaq jí ní daq dâqmıq nha._{:.t}<br>
> Goodbye. I'll remember this time forever.
