## Vocatives with _hóı_{:.t}

You can say _hóı_{:.t} followed by a noun --- say, someone's name --- to make a phrase that's like an interjection, calling out their name.

> _Hóı Álısı, jadı._{:.t} \
> Hello, Alice.
>
> _Hıchu, hóı súq!_{:.t} \
> Oi, you!

## Kinds of sentence: _da nha ba móq_{:.t}

By default, the sentences we make are statements: _Koı úmo_{:.t} means "we walk." There are some sentence-ending words that change this:

> _Koı úmo **nha.**_{:.t} \
> A promise: "We'll walk."
>
> _Koı úmo **ba.**_{:.t} \
> A wish/encouragement: "Let's walk."
>
> _Koı úmo **dâ.**_{:.t} \
> An explanation: "(It's just that) we walk."

If you don't say a sentence-ending word, _da_{:.t} (which ends a regular statement) is implied.

To ask questions, we use the sentence-ender _móq_{:.t}, but we also need to change the sentence a bit to make it clear just what it is we're asking. This alone won't do:

> _Seakuaı súq **móq?**_{:.t.bad} \
> An improper question: "You are tired?"

We need the word _ma_{:.t} in front of the sentence to make a proper yes--no question.

> _**Ma** seakuaı súq **móq?**_{:.t} \
> A yes-no question: "Are you tired?"

And in fact, a sentence that starts with _ma_{:.t} doesn't need _móq_{:.t} to be a question. If there is a question word in the sentence, _móq_{:.t} is implied instead of _da_{:.t}.

> _**Ma** seakuaı súq?_{:.t} \
> "Are you tired?"

Later, we'll learn how to form other kinds of question.

## Nouns with _ké_{:.t} and _ní_{:.t}

For the first time, this dialogue contains nouns that aren't proper nouns. In Toaq, nouns are formed from verbs, by adding an **article** before a verb. The two articles introduced in this lesson are _ké_{:.t} (the) and _ní_{:.t} (this here).

> _pıca → **ké** pıca_{:.t} \
> ▯ is a pizza → **the thing which** is a pizza
>
> _ké pıca_{:.t} \
> the pizza
>
> _de → **ní** de_{:.t} \
> ▯ is beautiful → **this here thing which** is beautiful
>
> _ní de_{:.t} \
> this beautiful thing

Toaq doesn't have separate singular and plural forms of nouns. A description like _ké&nbsp;pıca_{:.t} can really mean _the pizza_ or _the pizzas_.

<details class="aside grammar" markdown="1">
<summary>Endophoric and exophoric reference</summary>

Words like "this" and "that" and "he/she/they" can refer to something mentioned elsewhere in the text: this is called **endophoric** reference.

> I thought of <u>writing a card</u>, but **that** seemed impersonal.<br>
> <small>This kind of backwards reference is called _anaphora_.</small>
>
> Even though **she**'s not good at it, <u>Mary</u> enjoys chess.<br>
> <small>This kind of forwards reference is called _cataphora_.</small>

But sometimes they don't refer to anything mentioned elsewhere. Rather, they refer to something in the shared context between the speaker and the listener. This is called **exophoric** reference.

> _(pointing at a <u>cloud</u>)_ **That one** looks like a giraffe.<br>

Some Toaq words can only be used for anaphora, whereas others can only make exophoric reference.

- _Ní_{:.t} refers exophorically to something near the speaker.
- _Ké_{:.t} is a generic definite article, like "the." (It used to be only for exophoric reference, but nowadays it's generic.)

## The verb _to be_, _eq_{:.t}

So far, we've encountered plenty of sentences where there isn't an equivalent word to "is" in the Toaq sentence. The "is" is usually already baked into the verb. For example, _naq_{:.t} means "\_\_\_ is a man",  and _Naq Tóma_{:.t} means "Tóma is a man."

Sometimes, though, you have two nouns and just need to link them with an "is." In this case (and _only_ in this case) Toaq uses the verb _eq_{:.t}.

> _eq_{:.t} \
> ▯ is ▯
>
> _**Eq** ní naq Tóma._{:.t} \
> This man **is** Tóma.
>
> _**Eq** Tóma ní naq._{:.t} \
> Tóma **is** this man.
>
> _**Eq** jí nháo._{:.t} \
> I **am** him.
