## Conjunctions

These are the basic conjunction words in Toaq:

| _rú_{:.t} | X and Y |
| _kéo_{:.t} | X, but also/and yet, Y |
| _rá_{:.t} | X or Y or both |
| _ró_{:.t} | X or Y (but not both) |
| _rí_{:.t} | X or Y? (or both? or neither?) |

They can be used to join two nouns:

> _jí rá súq_{:.t}<br>
> me and/or you

Two relative clauses:

> _ꝡë fıeq súq hóa, rú, ꝡë cho jí hóa_{:.t}<br>
> which I like and which you invented

Two adverbs:

> _nhâme kéo mêo_{:.t}<br>
> smilingly, but sadly

Two prepositions:

> _râo ró bîe_{:.t}<br>
> on or after …

Two preposition phrases:

> _nêo ké toqfua rá nîe ké tıaı_{:.t}<br>
> on the table or in the box

Two clauses:

> _sea súq kéo guaı câı jí_{:.t}<br>
> you rest but I work hard

<summary>Conjunctions under the hood</summary>

Conjunctions are actually much like quantifiers.

The phrase _X rú Y_{:.t} is essentially _tú mem {X, Y}_{:.t}. It quantifies over all members of a domain consisting of X and Y. In this analogy, _rá_{:.t} is like _sá_{:.t} and _rí_{:.t} is like _hí_{:.t}.

This analogy is perfect for understanding the scope behavior of quantifiers:

> <center><div class="scope t"><span class="sb"><i>Ꝡa</i></span> dua&nbsp;<b>sía</b> poq, <div class="scope t s2"><span class="sb"><i>ꝡá</i></span> Toaqpoq súq&nbsp;<b>rú</b>&nbsp;nháo</div> da.</div>
>
> <br>↓<br> <!-- > <div class="scope t" style="font-size:0.8rem;"><b>Some</b>&nbsp;think <div class="scope" style="color:#e50">it's impossible <div class="scope sec">that&nbsp;<b>someone</b>&nbsp;knows&nbsp;<b>every</b>&nbsp;language.</div></div></div> -->
>
> <div class="scope t"><span class="sb"><i><ruby>∄p:</ruby></i></span> p knows <div class="scope t s2"><span class="sb"><i><ruby>∀x ∈ {you, her}:</ruby></i></span> x is a Toaqist.</div></div><br><small>Nobody knows that you and her are Toaqists.</small></center>

Changing the order of _rú_{:.t} and _sá_{:.t} changes the meaning of the following sentence pair.

> _Cho súq rú jí sá gıaq._{:.t}<br>
> You like some music, and I like some music.
>
> _Sá gıaq nä, cho súq rú jí hóa._{:.t}<br>
> There is some music that you and I both like.

It gets a bit stranger when X and Y themselves contain quantifiers.

> _Dua sá deo rú sía koaq ní._<br>
> Some children and no grown-ups know this.

We can think of this sentence as quantifying over a domain of two scope operators.

> <div class="scope t"><span class="sb"><i>∀Q ∈ {∃deo, ∄koaq}: Qx:</i></span> x knows this.</div>

</details>

### Nouns together with _róı_{:.t}

There is a special conjunction, _róı_{:.t}, that can only be used between nouns. It makes a new noun that consists of those nouns considered together as a [plurality](../15/).

> _Hıe súq **rú** jí sá toqfua._{:.t}<br>
> You (carry a table) **and** I carry a table.

> _Hıe súq **róı** jí sá toqfua._{:.t}<br>
> You **and** I carry a table (together).

This distinction is not so natural to make, coming from English. When you use _rú_{:.t}, you are claiming that something is true of one subject _and_ of another. When you use _róı_{:.t}, you are claiming something about a plural subject. Thus:

> _Shı súq **rú** jí._{:.t}<br>
> You **and** I are (both) one.

> _Gu súq **róı** jí._{:.t}<br>
> You-**and**-I are two.

## Parentheticals

You can open a parenthetical with _kïo_{:.t} and close it with _kı_{:.t}. It doesn't affect the grammar on the outside. The inside can be any grammatical Toaq text.

> _Zaı jí (**kïo** ma hao máo súq? **kı**), ꝡá dana jí nháo._{:.t}<br>
> I hope (do you, too?) that I defeat him.

If you start a parenthetical with _ïe_{:.t}, it interrupts a quote with some commentary.

> _Kuq nháo mó, « jaq esagı [**ïe** choq nháo hú toa **kı**] súq » teo._{:.t}<br>
> They said, "you're really awesome [that's the word they used]."

If there is no quote, then _ïe_{:.t} lifts the whole sentence to a quote. Inside the parenthetical, _hóa_{:.t} refers to the now-quoted sentence.

> _« He báq hobı, » **ïe** cuakuq jí hóa **kı**, « nä chuq hóa tú, ꝡë sam hó hóa tîtaı hóa. »_{:.t}<br>
> "A sheep," I answered, "eats anything it finds in its reach."
