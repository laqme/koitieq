## Conjunctions

These are the basic conjunction words in Toaq:

| _rú_{:.t} | X and Y |
| _kéo_{:.t} | X, but also/and yet, Y |
| _rá_{:.t} | X or Y or both |
| _ró_{:.t} | X or Y (but not both) |
| _rí_{:.t} | X or Y? (or both? or neither?) |

They can be used to join two nouns:

> _jí rá súq_{:.t}<br>
> me and/or you

Two relative clauses:

> _ꝡë fıeq súq hóa, rú, ꝡë cho jí hóa_{:.t}<br>
> which I like and which you invented

Two adverbs:

> _nhâme kéo mêo_{:.t}<br>
> smilingly, but sadly

Two prepositions:

> _râo ró bîe_{:.t}<br>
> on or after …

Two preposition phrases:

> _nêo ké toqfua rá nîe ké tıaı_{:.t}<br>
> on the table or in the box

Two clauses:

> _sea súq kéo guaı câı jí_{:.t}<br>
> you rest but I work hard

<summary>Conjunctions under the hood</summary>

Conjunctions are actually much like quantifiers.

The phrase _X rú Y_{:.t} is essentially _tú mem {X, Y}_{:.t}. It quantifies over all members of a domain consisting of X and Y. In this analogy, _rá_{:.t} is like _sá_{:.t} and _rí_{:.t} is like _hí_{:.t}.

This analogy is perfect for understanding the scope behavior of quantifiers:

> <center><div class="scope t"><span class="sb"><i>Ꝡa</i></span> dua&nbsp;<b>sía</b> poq, <div class="scope t s2"><span class="sb"><i>ꝡá</i></span> Toaqpoq súq&nbsp;<b>rú</b>&nbsp;nháo</div> da.</div>
>
> <br>↓<br> <!-- > <div class="scope t" style="font-size:0.8rem;"><b>Some</b>&nbsp;think <div class="scope" style="color:#e50">it's impossible <div class="scope sec">that&nbsp;<b>someone</b>&nbsp;knows&nbsp;<b>every</b>&nbsp;language.</div></div></div> -->
>
> <div class="scope t"><span class="sb"><i><ruby>∄p:</ruby></i></span> p knows <div class="scope t s2"><span class="sb"><i><ruby>∀x ∈ {you, her}:</ruby></i></span> x is a Toaqist.</div></div><br><small>Nobody knows that you and her are Toaqists.</small></center>

Changing the order of _rú_{:.t} and _sá_{:.t} changes the meaning of the following sentence pair.

> _Cho súq rú jí sá gıaq._{:.t}<br>
> You like some music, and I like some music.
>
> _Sá gıaq nä, cho súq rú jí hóa._{:.t}<br>
> There is some music that you and I both like.

It gets a bit stranger when X and Y themselves contain quantifiers.

> _Dua sá deo rú sía koaq ní._{:.t}<br>
> Some children and no grown-ups know this.

We can think of this sentence as quantifying over a domain of two scope operators.

> <div class="scope t"><span class="sb"><i>∀Q ∈ {∃deo, ∄koaq}: Qx:</i></span> x knows this.</div>

<summary>Continuations (advanced)</summary>

### The continuation hypothesis

We've seen that quantified expressions like _sá poq_{:.t} can show up in the same places as non-quantified expressions like _nhána_{:.t}, but their semantic effect is very different. It seems like _sá poq_{:.t} "locally" does the same thing (refer to some variable) but it has an effect at the top of the clause (introducing a quantifier).

In this chapter, once again, _jí ró súq_{:.t} shows up in the same places as _jí_{:.t}, and locally refers to a variable, but introduces an "or" at the clause-level. How can we make sense of this?

We follow Chris Barker's [continuation hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation#Linguistics) in saying that these phrases have _denotations that manipulate their own continuations_. What does this mean?

A **continuation** is a concept from computer science. When evaluating a subexpression in some larger context, the "rest of the expression" is that expression's continuation.

The subexpression 4&nbsp;×&nbsp;5 has the continuation 2&nbsp;×&nbsp;3&nbsp;+&nbsp;⬚ in this example:

> 2 × 3 + <mark style="background: rgba(255,255,255,0.6);padding: 0px 2px;border: 1px solid;">4 × 5</mark><br>

### Continuations in Toaq

In the case of Toaq, the context is a **clause**. If nouns normally have type _e_ and propositions normally have type _t_, then we say _sá poq_{:.t} denotes a function from _(e → t)_ to _t_. For example, we say that in _Chuq sá poq máq_{:.t}, the **continuation** of _sá poq_{:.t} is the function

> _Chuq ⬚ máq_{:.t}<br>
> κ : e → t<br>
> κ = λp. _chuq(p, máq)_{:.t}

and the meaning of sá poq is a function that manipulates this continuation:

> _sá poq_{:.t}<br>
> s : (e → t) → t<br>
> s = λκ. _∃p: poq(p) and κ(p)_{:.t}

so that the whole clause means

> _Chuq sá poq máq_{:.t}<br>
> s(κ) : t<br>
> s(κ) = _∃p: poq(p) and chuq(p, máq)_{:.t}

This is a powerful abstraction. It lets us treat _jí ró súq_{:.t} just the same way:

> _jí ró súq_{:.t} : (e → t) → t<br>
> = λκ. _κ(jí) or κ(súq)_{:.t}

The idea of giving noun phrases type (e → t) → t is already found in early takes on natural language semantics, such as [Montague grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montague_grammar). For more on continuations, you can consult the book [_Continuations and Natural Language_](https://home.uni-leipzig.de/gkobele/courses/2023.SS/Colloq/files/BS.Book.pdf) by Barker and Shan.

### Nouns together with _róı_{:.t}

There is a special conjunction, _róı_{:.t}, that can only be used between nouns. It makes a new noun that consists of those nouns considered together as a [plurality](../15/).

> _Hıe súq **rú** jí sá toqfua._{:.t}<br>
> You (carry a table) **and** I carry a table.
>
> _Hıe súq **róı** jí sá toqfua._{:.t}<br>
> You **and** I carry a table (together).

This distinction is not so natural to make, coming from English. When you use _rú_{:.t}, you are claiming that something is true of one subject _and_ of another. When you use _róı_{:.t}, you are claiming something about a plural subject. Thus:

> _Shı súq **rú** jí._{:.t}<br>
> You **and** I are (both) one.

> _Gu súq **róı** jí._{:.t}<br>
> You-**and**-I are two.


<details class="aside grammar" markdown="1">
<summary>Advanced conjunctions with <i class=t>nạ</i></summary>

The prefix _nạ_{:.t} lets us turn any verb that relates two events or clauses into a conjunction.

> _bıe_{:.t}<br>
> ▯ takes place after ▯
>
> _Hıaı jí **nạ́bıe** kuq súq sá luaı._{:.t}<br>
> I laugh **after** you say something funny.

Basically, _X nạ́verb Y_{:.t} means: X and Y both happen, and the events/facts are related by _verb_{:.t}.

By extension, such a conjunction can be applied to any part of speech. The formula is: _P(X nạ́verb Y)_{:.t} means _P(X) nạ́verb P(Y)_{:.t}.

> _Shuaq jí **nạ́ca** súq báq hıaıse._{:.t}<br>
> [I **ca** you] produce laughter.<br>
> I produce laughter **causing** you to produce laughter.

## Parentheticals

You can open a parenthetical with _kïo_{:.t} and close it with _kı_{:.t}. It doesn't affect the grammar on the outside. The inside can be any grammatical Toaq text.

> _Zaı jí **(kïo ma hao máo súq kı?)**, ꝡá dana jí nháo._{:.t}<br>
> I hope **(do you, too?)** that I defeat him.

A similar construct, _ïe … kı_{:.t}, lifts the whole current or preceding sentence to a quote. On the inside, _hóa_{:.t} refers to the now-quoted sentence.

> _« He báq hobı, » **ïe cuakuq jí hóa kı**, « nä chuq hóa tú, ꝡë sam hó hóa tîtaı hóa. »_{:.t}<br>
> "A sheep," **I answered,** "eats anything it finds in its reach."
