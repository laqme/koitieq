Toaq is a constructed language, or _conlang:_ a human language created with a purpose, like Esperanto or Toki Pona. The name is pronounced /ˈtʰo.aŋ/.

What, then, is its purpose? Toaq is a **loglang**, in the tradition of Loglan and Lojban. Conlangs in this family investigate the interaction between logic and language. Specifically, in Toaq, each valid sentence has a single way to parse its grammar, and then _calculate_ its meaning by following a certain algorithm.

To avoid any confusion or debate about the precise definition of the word _loglang_, we sometimes also refer to this goal by saying that Toaq is **monoparsing**.

At the same time, Toaq is also an **artlang**. It tries to achieve its loglang goals in a way that still feels like a natural language. Its design weighs "logic" with elegance and aesthetics.

The word _báq_{:.t} is a Toaq word.

Essentially, Toaq is a _formal language_ in which you may talk about everyday things. It looks like this:

## Nouns with _kwꝡé_{:.t} and _ní_{:.t}

For the first time, this dialogue contains nouns that aren't proper nouns. In Toaq, nouns are formed from verbs, by adding an **article** before a verb. The two articles introduced in this lesson are _ké_{:.t} (the) and _ní_{:.t} (this).
