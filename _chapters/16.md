## Prefixes

Toaq words can have **prefixes** at the start. These are written with an underdot beneath the first vowel, and pronounced as a little glottal stop during that vowel.

{:.tone-figure}
_**bụq**foıge_{:.t1} _**ẹ́**guaı_{:.t2} _**hı̣̂**kuı_{:.t4}
<audio controls class="center-audio"><source src="../assets/audio/prefix.mp3"></audio>

Prefixes change the meaning of the word they're attached to in some predictable way. For example, _bụq_{:.t} makes a verb "bigger" or more intense, and _gẹ_{:.t} makes it small or quaint.

<blockquote markdown="1">

_foıge_{:.t}<br>▯ is boring

_**bụq**foıge_{:.t}<br>▯ is **super**-boring

_chaı_{:.t}<br>▯ is some tea

_**gẹ**chaı_{:.t}<br>▯ is **a spot of** tea
</blockquote>

Prefixes are "lexically separate" from verbs. That means: _bụq-_{:.t} (super) has nothing to do with the word _buq_{:.t} (mouth).

<details class="aside culture" markdown="1">
<summary>Typing underdots</summary>

These underdots can be hard to type on a phone or computer, and sadly, many fonts don't support them. So you'll just as often see people write prefixed words by simply placing a hyphen or colon after the prefix, like _buq-foıge_{:.t} or _ge:chaı_{:.t}.

Another system is to move the tone mark to the first syllable of the actual word, adding a "falling tone mark" if necessary. So _bụ́qfoıge_{:.t} becomes _buqfóıge_{:.t} and _gẹchaı_{:.t} becomes _gechàı_{:.t}.

Which way do you think looks best?

## Useful prefixes

The prefix _ẹ-_{:.t} turns verbs into single-slot "event of" verbs: if _chuq_{:.t} is to eat, then _ẹchuq_{:.t} is "to be an event of eating."

<blockquote markdown="1">

_guaı_{:.t}<br>▯ works

_**ẹ**guaı_{:.t}<br>▯ is a work-event

_**ẹ́**guaı_{:.t}<br>the work-event
</blockquote>

The prefix _bẹ-_{:.t} turns verbs into **generic adjectives**: if _toa_{:.t} is _word_, then _bẹtoa_{:.t} means "related to _báq toa_{:.t}", so _of words_ or _verbal_.

<blockquote markdown="1">

_guaıche_{:.t}<br>▯ is a worker

_**bẹ**guaıche_{:.t}<br>▯ is of workers

</blockquote>

The prefix _rạ-_{:.t} tells you that a verb is maybe a bit inexact.

<blockquote markdown="1">

_echı_{:.t}<br>▯ is a key

_**rạ**’echı_{:.t}<br>▯ is like, a key or something

</blockquote>

## Object-filling

Short pronouns have prefix forms that fill the object slot of a verb. The result is a new single-slot verb, which can then be used as a noun:

<blockquote markdown="1">

_paı_{:.t}<br>▯ is a friend of ▯

_**sụq**paı_{:.t}<br>▯ is a friend of **you**

_hú sụqpaı_{:.t}<br>that friend of yours

</blockquote>

The same is true for articles.

<blockquote markdown="1">

_**sı̣a**paı_{:.t}<br>▯ is a friend of **nobody**

_**tụ**paı_{:.t}<br>▯ is a friend of **everyone**

_kuı_{:.t}<br>▯ is because of ▯

_**hı̣**kuı_{:.t}<br>▯ is because of **what**?

_hı̣̂kuı_{:.t}<br>why?

</blockquote>

<details class="aside grammar" markdown="1">
<summary>Article prefix scope</summary>

These prefix forms of articles aren't scope operators. Rather, the quantification is "baked into" the definition of the new verb.

> _Pu geq jí sá **tụ**paı._{:.t}<br>I met a friend**-of-everyone**.

This _tụ-_{:.t} doesn't wrap the clause in a for-all, and so this sentence doesn't mean the same thing as:

> _Tú poq nä, pu geq jí sá **họ**paı._{:.t}<br>For every person, I met a friend**-of-them**.

</details>

## Stacking prefixes

You can have more than one prefix on a word. The glottal stop and underdot go on the first vowel of the **last** prefix.

> _meo_{:.t}<br>▯ feels sad
>
> _gẹmeo_{:.t}<br>▯ feels a little sad
>
> _egẹmeo_{:.t}<br>▯ is an event of feeling a little sad

<details class="aside grammar" markdown="1">
<summary>The shape of prefixes</summary>

How do we know _egẹmeo_{:.t} isn't some single prefix _egẹ-_{:.t} attached to the word _meo_{:.t}?

Every prefix has the same shape: it starts with a consonant, then some vowels, and then an optional _q_{:.t} or _m_{:.t}. This shape is called a **raku**. Every Toaq word is made up of one or more _raku_, but every _prefix_ is exactly one _raku_.

This means that there are some pronouns that don't have a prefix form: _nhána_{:.t} (they, plural) is two _raku_ long, and so it can't become a prefix.

To parse a hypothetical word like _beıcoeqdạıfeugımhao_{:.t}, we split off _raku_ from the front until we find the underdot:

> _beı- / coeq- / **dạı-** / feugımhao_{:.t}

And now we recognize this as three prefixes attached to the word _feugımhao_{:.t}.

But wait! What about _ẹ-_{:.t}? Doesn't that start with a vowel?

Well, when a Toaq word is written with a vowel at the start, there's actually an implied glottal stop before it that we don't write. In the middle of a word, we do write this glottal stop as an apostrophe.

> _Afarı_{:.t} /ʔa.fa.ɾi/<br>African
>
> _Namı'afarı_{:.t} /na.mi.ʔa.fa.ɾi/<br>South African

<audio controls class="center-audio"><source src="../assets/audio/afari-namiafari.mp3"></audio>

It's the same for prefixes, and this lets us split any word into _raku_.

> _ẹlao_{:.t} /ʔɛ̆ʔɛ̆.law/<br>a wait
>
> _ge’ẹlao_{:.t} /gɛ.ʔɛ̆ʔɛ̆.law/<br>a little wait
