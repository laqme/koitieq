Let's look at how to create more complex Toaq sentences: ones that involve subclauses.

## Vocabulary

| Word | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| _ruaq_{:.t} | ▯ states **ꝡá**{:.v} |
| _zoaı_{:.t} | ▯ doubts **ꝡá**{:.v} |
| _mıu_{:.t} | ▯ opines **ꝡá**{:.v} |
| _chı_{:.t} | ▯ believes **ꝡá**{:.v} |
| _dua_{:.t} | ▯ knows **ꝡá**{:.v} |
| _cuo_{:.t} | ▯ assumes **ꝡá**{:.v} |
| _aojaı_{:.t} | ▯ wants **ꝡá**{:.v} |
| _zaı_{:.t} | ▯ hopes **ꝡá**{:.v} |
| _juna_{:.t} | it's true that **ꝡá**{:.v} |
| _sahu_{:.t} | it's false that **ꝡá**{:.v} |
| _le_{:.t} | it's likely that **ꝡá**{:.v} |
| _laheq_{:.t} | **ꝡá**{:.v} implies **ꝡá**{:.v} |
| _dana_{:.t} | ▯ defeats ▯ |

## Content clauses

A content clause is introduced by _ꝡá_{:.t}, which means "that". It turns the following clause into a noun phrase, so that it can act as the subject or object of another clause.

In a Toaq dictionary, if a verb has "that ▯ is the case" in its definition, it means you can put a _ꝡá_{:.t}-clause there. In this textbook, we'll just write **ꝡá**{:.v} instead.

> _Jıa dana súq nháo._{:.t}<br>
> You will defeat him.
>
> _Chı jí, **ꝡá** jıa dana súq nháo._{:.t}<br>
> I believe **that** you will defeat him.

A **ꝡá**{:.v}-slot can still be filled by other nouns or pronouns, as long as they also refer to facts.

> _Chı jí **hú nıqdao**._{:.t}<br>
> I believe **the news**.
>
> _Ꝡá jıa dana súq nä, chı jí **hóa**._{:.t}<br>
> That you will defeat him — I believe **it**.

A verb can relate two content clauses. For example, the following sentence uses _laheq_{:.t} "**ꝡá**{:.v} implies **ꝡá**{:.v}".

> _Laheq, **ꝡá** zudeq súq Tóaqzu, **ꝡá** Toaqpoq súq._{:.t}<br>
> The fact that you speak Toaq implies that you're a Toaqist.

In Toaq, we write commas around the start and end of a subclause.

<summary>Terminators</summary>

If _ꝡá_{:.t} marks the beginning of a content clause, how do we mark the end? Doesn't that last example sentence need a terminator, like Lojban's _kei_?

A Toaq parser just looks at the arity of the verb to figure out where the clause ends. _Zudeq_{:.t} has two slots, so after _súq_{:.t} and _Tóaqzu_{:.t}, what follows can't be a third argument, and instead the clause must end here.

Trailing adverbs belong to a subclause, if possible. Consider this pair of sentences:

> _Ruaq jí, ꝡá noqgı ké haq râo fíachaq._{:.t}<br>
> I state **that the food was good yesterday.**

> _Ruaq râo fíachaq jí, ꝡá noqgı ké haq._{:.t}<br>
> I stated yesterday **that the food is good.**

<summary>Scope islands</summary>

In [Chapter 7](../7/), we learned about how _tú kompıuta_{:.t} wraps the clause it's in with a _for each computer_. Now that we are dealing with subclauses, it finally matters that we said "clause" instead of "sentence."

> _Zoaı nháo, ꝡá zujoe súq **tú** zu da._{:.t}<br>
> She doubts that you are fluent in each language.<br>

Words like _ꝡá_{:.t} create **scope islands**, and any "scope operator" (like _tú_{:.t} or _bu_{:.t}) applies to the innermost scope island containing it.

We can mark scope islands using rectangles. A word like _tú_{:.t} has its "for-each" apply to the smallest rectangle it's in:

> <center><div class="scope t"><span class="sb"><i>Ꝡa</i></span> chı&nbsp;<b>sía</b> poq, <div class="scope t s2"><span class="sb"><i>ꝡá</i></span> le, <div class="scope t s3"><span class="sb"><i>ꝡá</i></span> zujoe&nbsp;<b>sá tú</b>&nbsp;zu</div></div> da.</div>
>
> <br>↓<br> <!-- > <div class="scope t" style="font-size:0.8rem;"><b>Some</b>&nbsp;think <div class="scope" style="color:#e50">it's impossible <div class="scope sec">that&nbsp;<b>someone</b>&nbsp;knows&nbsp;<b>every</b>&nbsp;language.</div></div></div> -->
>
> <div class="scope t"><span class="sb"><i><ruby>∄p:<rt>no</rt></ruby></i></span> p thinks <div class="scope t s2"><span class="sb"><i>&ensp;</i></span> that it's likely <div class="scope t s3" style="padding-top:0.5rem"><span class="sb"><i><ruby>∃x:<rt>some</rt></ruby> <ruby>∀z:<rt>every</rt></ruby></i></span> x speaks z.</div></div></div><br><small>Nobody thinks it's likely that somebody speaks every language.</small></center>

## The word _ꝡa_{:.t}

The word _ꝡa_{:.t}, in the falling tone, marks the start of a _main_ clause, and therefore the start of a sentence.

Saying _ꝡa_{:.t} doesn't change the meaning of a sentence, but you can say it while thinking of what to say next, or just to clearly mark that you're starting a new sentence.

> _**Ꝡa…** jıa faq hí raı?_{:.t}<br>
> So… what's going to happen?
>
> _**Ꝡa** fa áma ké saodoaq dâ._{:.t}<br>
> We're going to the city.

<details class="aside history" markdown="1">
<summary>The word <em class="t">ꝡä</em></summary>

In official Toaq Delta, _ꝡä_{:.t.delta} is used instead of _ꝡá_{:.t} to make content clauses.

> _Chı jí, **ꝡä** jıa dana súq nháo._{:.t.delta}<br>
> I believe **that** you will defeat him.

This textbook adopts the idea that _ꝡä ꝡë_{:.t} attach to nouns while _ꝡá ꝡé_{:.t} introduce clauses that stand on their own.

> _Chı jí, **ꝡá** jıa dana súq nháo._{:.t}<br>
> I believe **that** you will defeat him.
>
> _Chı jí **ké chıse, ꝡä** jıa dana súq nháo._{:.t}<br>
> I hold **the belief that** you will defeat him.

In other words, _ꝡá_{:.t} is short for _báq raı ꝡä_{:.t} and _ꝡé_{:.t} is short for _báq raı ꝡë_{:.t}.

> _Cho jí, **ꝡé** fıeq súq hóa._{:.t}<br>
> I like **what** you invent.
>
> _Cho jí **báq lua, ꝡë** fıeq súq hóa._{:.t}<br>
> I like **stories that** you invent.
