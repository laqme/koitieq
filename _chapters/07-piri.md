## Topic and comment: _bï_{:.t}

You can start a sentence with a noun and _bï_{:.t} to specify a "topic" that the rest of the sentence is a "comment" on. It's like the subject and body of an email.

> _Níchaq **bï**, pırı Ráqsu._{:.t}<br>
> As for today: Ráqsu is annoyed.
>
> _Ké zu **bï**, de ké toa._{:.t}<br>
> As for the language: the words are beautiful.

This word is in the only tone we haven't seen yet: the **glottal tone**. It's pronounced as a low tone with a little "glottal stop" in the middle, like in "uh-oh" or "nuh-uh".

## More articles: _sá tú sía hú_{:.t}

The articles _sá, tú, sía_{:.t} mean "some, each, none," respectively.

> _Zueq **sá** koqpıuta._{:.t}<br>
> Some computers are broken. / A computer is broken.
>
> _Zueq **tú** koqpıuta._{:.t}<br>
> Each computer is broken.
>
> _Bo **sía** poq **tú** raı._{:.t}<br>
> Nobody has everything.

The determiner _hú_{:.t} means "the … just mentioned".

> _Cho jí **hú** kıq._{:.t}<br>
> I like that movie. (that we are talking about)

<details class="aside semantics" markdown="1">
<summary>Universe of discourse</summary>
When we say _tú poq_{:.t}, we don't mean "each person in the whole universe, in all of history and the entire future." Quantification is limited to the _universe of discourse_: some implicit set of "all the things we are talking about."
</details>

<details class="aside grammar" markdown="1">
<summary>Quantification</summary>
The articles _sá tú sía_{:.t} are _quantifying_ articles. A phrase like _tú koqpıuta_{:.t} implies a quantifying phrase like _for each computer x…_ around its clause. The phrase itself then refers to this variable _x_.

> _= [For each koqpıuta x]_{: style="visibility:hidden;padding-right:0.125rem"} _Zueq tú koqpıuta._{:.t}<br>
> = [For each _koqpıuta_{:.t} x] _Zueq_{:.t} _x_{: style="padding:0 2.4rem;"}

We'll use the logical symbols ∃ "there exists", ∀ "for all", and ¬ "not" in logical formulas. Specifically, we'll use the notation below to indicate a quantification over a limited domain given by some other formula:

> [∀x: _koqpıuta_{:.t}(x)]<br>
> Read: "for each computer x…"

Similarly, _sá_{:.t} means "for some _x_ …" and _sía_{:.t} means "for no _x_ …".

> _Faq **sá** huı._{:.t}<br>
> [∃x: _huı_{:.t}(x)] _Faq_{:.t} x.<br>
> Something bad happened.

> _Geq jí **sía** poq._{:.t}<br>
> [¬∃x: _poq_{:.t}(x)] _Geq jí_{:.t} x.<br>
> I met nobody.

If there are multiple quantifying articles in a sentence, the earliest one has its corresponding quantifier on the outside.

> _Sıom **tú** poq **sá** zu._{:.t}<br>
> [∀p: _poq_{:.t}(p)] [∃z: _zu_{:.t}(z)] _Sıom_{:.t} p z.<br>
> Each person studies some language.

## Vague verbs

| Word | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| _raı_{:.t} | ▯ is anything |
| _nu_{:.t} | ▯ is such, is like that |
| _hao_{:.t} | ▯ is you-know-what |

The word _raı_{:.t} is a verb that is always true of anything. So _tú raı_{:.t} is "everything", _ní raı_{:.t} is "this", and so on.

> _Faq ké **raı** nha._{:.t}<br>
> **It**'ll happen.
>
> _Bo sía poq **tú raı**._{:.t}<br>
> Nobody has **everything**.

If you use an article without a following verb, it means the same thing as using _raı_{:.t}.

> _Bo sía poq **tú**._{:.t}<br>
> Nobody has **everything**.

The word _nu_{:.t} refers to some property that's under discussion. It's like a demonstrative verb.

> _**Nu** máo jí._{:.t}<br>
> I'm **like that** too.
>
> _Zao jí **sía nu**._{:.t}<br>
> I know no **such** things.

_Hao_{:.t} is a verb that means: "you know what I mean." You can use it when a more specific verb isn't really necessary, because you trust the listener to fill the gap.

In English, it corresponds to vague descriptions or even missing words:

> _Zueq ké **hao** da._{:.t}<br>
> The thingy is broken.
>
> _**Hao** úmo ba._{:.t}<br>
> Let's.
