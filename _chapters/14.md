## Negation

The word _bu_{:.t} means "not": it **negates** the clause it's in. It usually goes at the start of a clause, but it can occur in other places as well.

> _**Bu** seakuaı jí._{:.t}<br>
> I'm not tired.

> _**Bu** suaq tú poq._{:.t}<br>
> It's not the case that everyone sings.

> _Tú poq nä, **bu** suaq hóa._{:.t}<br>
> Each person (is such that) they didn't sing.

> _Pu **bu** choaısao ké hao nha._{:.t}<br>
> The stuff wasn't expensive.

<summary>Bu and scope</summary>

Just like the quantifying articles _sá_{:.t} wraps its scope island in a "there exists" (∃) and _tú_{:.t} wraps it scope island in a "for all" (∀), the word _bu_{:.t} wraps its scope island in a _not_ (¬).

{:style="text-align:center"}
> <small>Ꝡa chı jí, ꝡá pu <b>bu</b> suaq <b>sá</b> poq da.</small>
>
> <div class="scope t"><span class="sb"><i>Ꝡa</i></span> chı jí, <div class="scope t s2"><span class="sb"><i>ꝡá</i></span> pu <b>bu</b> suaq <b>sá</b> poq</div> da.</div>
>
> <div class="scope t"><span class="sb"><i>&ensp;</i></span>I believe <div class="scope t s2"><span class="sb"><i>¬ ∃p:</i></span><b>p</b> sang.</div></div>
>
> {:style="margin-top:0"}
> <small>I believe nobody sang.

The operators ¬ and ∃p in the formula reflect the order of _bu_{:.t} and _sá_{:.t} in the original sentence. And so if we reorder these words, the meaning changes.

{:style="text-align:center"}
> <small>Ꝡa chı jí, ꝡá <b>sá</b> poq nä pu <b>bu</b> suaq hó da.</small>
>
> <div class="scope t"><span class="sb"><i>Ꝡa</i></span> chı jí, <div class="scope t s2"><span class="sb"><i>ꝡá</i></span> <b>sá</b> poq nä pu <b>bu</b> suaq hó</div> da.</div>

> {:style="margin-top:0"}
> <small>I believe there was a person who didn't sing.

<summary>What gets negated, exactly?</summary>

### Episodic sentences

Episodic Toaq sentences claim that certain events exist at some time. That means a simple sentence with _bu_{:.t} (or _sía_{:.t}) claims the non-existence of a certain kind of event.

> _Tı jí Súomıgua._{:.t}<br>
> I was in Finland.<br>
> <small markdown="1">There exists some event _e_ at time _t_ of me being in Finland.</small>

> _**Bu** tı jí Súomıgua._{:.t}<br>
> I wasn't in Finland.<br>
> <small markdown="1">**It's false that** there exists some event _e_ at time _t_ of me being in Finland.</small>

Because this variable _t_ is a ["vague, definite" time](../8), we don't claim that we _never_ were or _never_ will be in Finland — only that it didn't happen within the time we are talking about.

If there are other quantifiers, _bu_{:.t} may negate a larger claim:

> _Geq jí tú lıq._{:.t}<br>
> I met every woman.<br>
> <small markdown="1">For each woman _L_, there exists some event _e_ at time _t_ of me meeting _L_.</small>
>
> _**Bu** geq jí tú lıq._{:.t}<br>
> It's false that I met every woman.<br>
> <small markdown="1">**It's false that**, for each woman _L_, there exists some event _e_ at time _t_ of me meeting _L_.</small>

(By the way, when a sentence refers to a "vague definite time" _t_, we take this to be the same _t_ for the whole sentence, across all assignments of variables: _Geq jí tú lıq_{:.t} comes with a guarantee that "the time we are talking about" isn't different from one woman to the next.)

### Generic sentences

In generic sentences, _he_{:.t} also acts as a scope operator, and so the order of it and _bu_{:.t} matters:

> _He **bu** jaı báq poq._{:.t}<br>
> People are unhappy.<br>
> <small markdown="1">It's true that, as a rule, there are **no** events of people being happy.</small>

> _**Bu** he jaı báq poq._{:.t}<br>
> People aren't happy.<br>
> <small markdown="1">It is **not** true that, as a rule, there are events of people being happy.</small>

### Tense

It usually doesn't matter which way around _bu_{:.t} and the tense word are.

> _**Bu** naı casuao hú._{:.t}<br>
> _Naı **bu** casuao hú._{:.t}<br>
> (**¬** ∃e) That doesn't matter now.

But if it's an existential tense, like _mala_{:.t}, the order matters, just like it does between _bu_{:.t} and _sá_{:.t}.

> _**Bu** <span class="s2">mala</span> casuao hú._{:.t}<br>
> (**¬** <span class="s2">∃t</span> ∃e) That has never mattered.
>
> _<span class="s2">Mala</span> **bu** casuao hú._{:.t}<br>
> (<span class="s2">∃t</span> **¬** ∃e) One time, that didn't matter.

## Focus

The word _kú_{:.t} marks the following noun or adverb as **new information**, and the rest of the sentence as old news. It's often used when answering an actual or implied question.

> _Heaq jí **kú** ké haqsaı._{:.t}<br>
> _The groceries_ are what I'm carrying.<br>
> <small>Answers the implied question "What are you carrying?"</small>
>
> _Chı jí **kú**, ꝡá shuıja nháo sá raı._{:.t}<br>
> What I think is, that she's hiding something.<br>
> <small>Answers the implied question "What do you think?"</small>

The word _béı_{:.t} is similar. It marks the following noun or adverb as **contrasting** information. It negates some alternative statement. It's often used when correcting what someone else might think.

> _Heaq jí **béı** <em>ké haqsaı</em>._{:.t}<br>
> (No,) I'm carrying the GROCERIES.<br>
> <small>Negates some implied statement like "You're carrying the clothes."</small>

There isn't really an English translation of _kú_{:.t} or _béı_{:.t}, because this information is normally expressed using prosody or word order in English.
