This lesson covers pronouns that refer back to earlier descriptions, and how those are bound.

## Conversation

Íqse and Rúa are talking about music they like.

> **Íqse:** _Ní gıaqche nä, ma zao súq **hóa**?_{:.t}<br>
> **Rúa:** _Nho, zao jí **hó**!_{:.t.sec}<br>
> **Íqse:** _Jaq sıeqge ké nıq, dá?_{:.t}<br>
> **Rúa:** _Noga, bo **tá** báq suaqtoa naına ꝡeı._{:.t.sec}<br>
> **Íqse:** _Ma he baı súq báq gıaq?_{:.t}<br>
> **Rúa:** _Sá gıaq nä, mala baı jí **hóq**._{:.t.sec}<br>
> **Íqse:** _Bo jí báq gıta. Choq jí **máq** ba..._{:.t}<br>
> **Rúa:** _Nhooo, fıeq úmo báq esagı chôq **gíta** ba!_{:.t.sec}<br>

## The words _nä_{:.t} and _hóa_{:.t}

You can "float" a noun to the front of the sentence, or really anywhere else, by placing it before _nä_{:.t}. Then, you can refer to it later in the sentence with the pronoun _hóa_{:.t}.

> _Ní gıaqche nä, ma zao súq **hóa**?_{:.t}<br>
> This musician, do you know **him**?
>
> _Ma zao, ní gıaqche nä, súq **hóa**?_{:.t}<br>
> Do you know — this musician — do you know **him**?

<summary>Nä and scope</summary>

Generally, scope in Toaq is left to right: if a _tú_{:.t} is to the left of a _sá_{:.t}, the for-all quantification is on the outside of the there-exists quantification.

Using _nä_{:.t}, we can not only move words around to where we want them, we can also rearrange their scopes:

> _Zudeq **tú** poq **sá** zu._{:.t}<br>
> **Every** person has **some** language that they speak.
>
> _**Sá** zu nä, zudeq **tú** poq hóa._{:.t}<br>
> There is **some** language, that **every** person speaks.

Another example is that quantifiers have their scope limited by the clause they're in. Using _nä_{:.t}, we can pull a quantifier out of the clause.

> _Aojaı jí, ꝡá chuq jí **sía** raı._{:.t}<br>
> I want that [I eat nothing].<br>
> _(i.e., I want to fast)_
>
> _**Sía** raı nä aojaı jí, ꝡá chuq jí hóa._{:.t}<br>
> There is nothing that [I want that [I eat it]].<br>
> _(i.e., I'm not hungry)_

## Variables

After a description using an article, like _sá poq_{:.t} or _ké nıq_{:.t}, there are pronouns called **variables** that you can use to refer to this description.

Most simply, you can repeat the verb in the rising tone: after _sá poq_{:.t}, "some person _x_", you can say _póq_{:.t} to refer to _x_. We say that _sá poq_{:.t} _binds_ the variable _póq_{:.t}.

> _He chı **sá poq**, ꝡá he cho tú raı **póq**._{:.t}<br>
> **Some people** believe that everybody likes **them**.

If there's an adjective, you only repeat the "noun" (first word after the article). And as we can see in the next sentence, this strategy is also compatible with _nä_{:.t}. You might prefer it over _hóa_{:.t} to make it clear what you're referring back to.

> _Sá **chaq** de nä, jıa geq jí súq râo **cháq**._{:.t}<br>
> **Some** beautiful **day**… I'll meet you on **that day**.

However, repeating the same word can be a bit cumbersome.

> _Ruaq **ké galeche**, ꝡá laheq, ꝡá sıomoı **gáleche**, ꝡá jıq **gáleche**._{:.t}<br>
> The **teacher** states: that **he** thinks implies that **he** exists.

There are a few other pronouns that get bound whenever you use an article. Which pronoun gets bound by which verb depends on that verb's _class_.

## Verb classes

All Toaq verbs belong to one of four "classes". You can think of these like masculine/feminine genders in French or Spanish. Each class is named after its corresponding pronoun:

| pronoun | words in this class | examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| _hó_{:.t} ("he/she") | words describing people and animals | _deo_{:.t}, _gochıq_{:.t} |
| _máq_{:.t} ("it") | words describing physical things | _koqpıuta_{:.t}, _haq_{:.t} |
| _hóq_{:.t} ("it") | words describing abstract things | _sıo_{:.t}, _gıaq_{:.t} |
| _tá_{:.t} ("it") | other words (mostly "adjectives") | _suoı_{:.t}, _de_{:.t} |

After saying _ké galeche_{:.t}, instead of having to say _gáleche_{:.t} again, you can also use _hó_{:.t}, because _galeche_{:.t} is a _hó_{:.t}-class word.

All four of these pronouns occur in this lesson's conversation. Which words do they refer to?

<details class="aside grammar" markdown="1">
<summary>More on verb classes</summary>

You don't have to memorize which class each word belongs to: you can figure it out by thinking about the meaning. For example, _gıaq_{:.t} describes music, which is an abstract/intangible phenomenon, and so _gıaq_{:.t} is a _hóq_{:.t}-class word.

But what's important is that verb class is a property _of the verb, not of the thing it refers to_.

For example, after saying _sá suoı_{:.t} to refer to an important king, the pronoun that gets bound is _tá_{:.t}, not _hó_{:.t}. The word _hó_{:.t} is not for referring to people, but to _hó_{:.t}-class verbs. And _suoı_{:.t} is _tá_{:.t}-class.

If we instead say _sá req suoı_{:.t}, the appropriate pronoun is _hó_{:.t}, because _req_{:.t} describes people. It's the first word after the article that decides which pronoun gets bound.
